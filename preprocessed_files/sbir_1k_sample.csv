In this environment, a communications link can be affected by multi-path scattering and therefore the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the link fluctuates over time with the movement of the transmitter or the receiver. Furthermore, maintaining reliable communication links in dense signal environments becomes especially challenging where strong and weak signals mingle close to each other in frequency. This condition is exacerbated as the Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW) of the receiver becomes wider and bit-depth is reduced, making it vulnerable to saturation and clipping. To counteract these effects, Expedition Technology, Inc. (EXP) is proposing Fast Recovery Of Signal Estimates using Neural Networks (FROSENN). FROSENN will be able to reduce re-acquisition time of signals that are dropped due to deep-fading and estimate and predict the lost signal using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs). In addition, these MLAs will counter saturation effects by separating the interfering signals and any intermodulation products from the desired SOI(s).

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to detect signatures of faults that are as weak as 1% of the total signal magnitude. The Phase I research will include the evaluation of available data analysis methodologies, such as the PCA. The selected methods will be tested with real forging press data for the fault of colder than-normal die temperature. If successful, the developed control charts will be implemented on a test site to verify the detection performance for 30 days.

The Air Force is interested in new laser hardening methods to bring another layer of protection beyond the standard materials-based solution for the detector array.  More recently, the focus has been on readout integrated circuit (ROIC).      Our Collaborator, L-3 CE has demonstrated some advanced techniques to laser harden the ROIC, including current limiters at the column level, circuit redundancy, and the addition of top metal layers.  As a result, they have been able to fabricate FPAs that are immune to laser kill.

There currently exists no method to directly measure peak fuel temperature in emerging Gen-IV reactors. Lambda Instruments, Inc. is developing extremely high-temperature, radiation-hardened fiber optic temperature sensors based on our unique sapphire waveguide technology. Sapphire is an inherently high-temperature material and has been shown to retain excellent transmission properties in moderate radiation and extreme high-temperature environments. All of the primary objectives of the Phase I were achieved with great success. Sapphire fibers were shown to survive in both high temperature (1600C) and moderate radiation (3.3x1017n/cm2, &amp; gt;1MeV) environments. Temperature sensor fabrication methods for high-temperature operation were designed and implemented. These initial fabrication methods demonstrated success at high temperatures up to 1600C. Additional fabrication methods for improved sensor ruggedization and survivability were also conceived and will be implemented during the Phase II project. The primary objectives for Phase II include: 1) Improving temperature sensor ruggedization, 2) Design and build optimized readout system, 3) Demonstrate extended survivability in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, 4) Demonstrate operation in high-radiation environment, and 5) Develop commercialization and transition to manufacturing strategy. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The primary commercial applications include emerging Gen-IV VHTR plants. The primary public benefit will be improving the safety and performance of emerging high temperature gas-cooled reactors. With growing international competition in nuclear power, the U.S. is at risk of losing our preeminent position in new reactor development.

The design leverages the thin form factor, optical transmissivity, and cost advantages of organic printed electronics in a novel configuration to allow for environmentally stable, active-array touch surfaces and displays to be produced with scalable manufacturing techniques. The solution is intended to enable truly force sensitive touch that is low cost and highly sensitive. It will be operable with any object, including fingernails, gloves, and styluses, while not being susceptible to environmental factors that hinder current capacitive technologies, such as dirt and moisture. If successfully developed it will consume less power than leading technologies, and will not inherently require special materials such as glass to be used as the touch surface.

This leads to 25 quads of low-level energy (~ $200 billion) wasted annually in the US. This reduces US manufacturing competitiveness, contributes to GHG emissions, and leads to unhealthy environment. In the building sector this causes poor ventilation, leading to a sick building syndrome and increased vulnerability to the spread of pathogens and viruses such as Covid-19. The T2M team is developing a mass producible modular plastic heat exchanger (P-HEX) which can be extruded at very high-speeds, making it affordable for low-level heat recovery. Its very thin walls, made of conductive polymer composites, coupled with a very high packing density make it efficient and cost-effective with a smaller physical footprint. A baseline P-HEX design with novel ultra-thin self-supporting tube structure was manufactured and validated meeting all DOE targets with excellent feasibility. The primary goals are to scaleup the P-HEX technology by 10x including high-speed manufacturing processes. A market responsive P-HEX module will be designed for different market sectors. P-HEX pressure capability will be increased to meet the need of these market sectors. Benefits to Federal Government: Deployment of P-HEX will reduce HVAC bills by over $1 billion/yr, better ventilation will lead to greater productivity and extended mission duration for DoD. Up to 25% Reduction in Energy Use: P-HEX would reduce energy consumption in buildings, industries, transportation, and stationery power sectors. Our preliminary estimations show up to 50 billion terms in savings from reduced fuel consumption. Solution for the Sick Building Syndrome and Post-COVID Safety: P-HEX provides a cost- effective solution for ventilation to achieve 40 cfm/person while decreasing HVAC bills. Significant Cost Savings to Ratepayers and Consumers: The recovered heat by P-HEX translates to $50 billion/yr in savings to consumers, improving U.S. competitiveness. Supporting Intermittent Renewables: Resulting Natural Gas savings from P-HEX deployment will support intermittency of solar and wind, as well as microgrids needed for resiliency against natural disasters. National Energy Security: The highly efficient P-HEX reduces the dependency on imported fossil fuels from politically unstable regions, thus enhancing a sustainable economy.Reduced GHG Emissions: P-HEX recovers process heat without additional harmful emissions. It will strengthen the U.S. position to comply with the Paris Agreement. Job Creation: Deployment of P-HEX will create &gt;50,000 domestic jobs in manufacturing, installation, service and the associated ripple effects (assuming 1 job per GWh saved).",NIRAJ PATEL,,(203) 947-2681,RAJPATEL@T2MGLOBAL.COM,PINAKIN PATEL,,(203) 300-6130,PPATEL@T2MGLOBAL.COM,,,,"['ultra-thin', 'effective', 'saving consumer', 'productivity', 'import', 'couple high packing density', 'sector', 'solution', 'p-hex pressure', 'heat', 'team', 'Safety', 'sustainable economy', 'service', 'market', 'stationery power sector', 'operating temperature', 'manufacturing', 'vulnerability', 'estimation', 'low-level', 'ventilation', 'lead unhealthy environment', 'transportation', 'p-hex module', 'Sick building syndrome post-covid', 'National Energy Security', 'emission', 'self-supporting tube structure manufacture', 'poor ventilation', 'energy consumption', 'Ratepayers consumer', 'design', 'building sector', 'cost', 'high-speed manufacturing process', 'physical footprint', 'Energy Use', 'cost-effective', 'Gas saving p-hex deployment', 'Paris Agreement', 'industry', 'pathogen virus', 'solar wind', 'conductive polymer', 'mission']"

Information protection is provided without a reliable centralized network or security service, supports intermittent connectivity, and where address and physical location are indeterminant. Secure peer-to-peer communication is secured, along with security to forward nodes that are subject to capture.  MotionSafe is a highly efficient system, incorporating standard symmetric encryption, an innovative encryption key management system and efficient data management protocols to minimize the ad-hoc network constraints of bandwidth, energy, processing and storage.

In addition to technology creation, system testing and evaluation is anticipated to be accomplished at the National Guard Bureau / Army National Guard headquarters facility in Arlington, VA in cooperation with the Army National Guard (ANG).  The project will make use of the current capabilities of the ObjectVideoT Video Early Warning (VEW) system, and the advanced capabilities emerging in this Phase II STTR research and development effort.  The participation of the National Guard Bureau / Army National Guard in this project will provide rigorous testing of these technologies in real world environments, under realistic conditions and against real world problems.    There are three key technical challenges. (1) Development of learning algorithms, so that the software can automatically classify unusual nocturnal behavior without user specification. (2)  Development of suitable computer vision algorithms so that the system can hand off targets between multiple color, low-light, or thermal cameras at night. (3) Development of suitable computer vision algorithms for robust nighttime object detection, tracking, and classification that greatly exceed the performance of today's systems. ObjectVideo already has significant experience with computer vision-based automated video surveillance technologies and their application to real-world physical security and force protection challenges.  Our interactions with customers in dozens of real-world deployments that include coverage of ports of entry on the Northern US Border reinforce the central ideas behind this project: 1) that installed CCTV and lighting infrastructure is often designed for daytime operation and produces video signals that are unusable by either human security professionals or automated systems such as VEW at night, 2) that a broad range of nighttime phenomenology that ranges from sensor effects (AGC, automatic calibration), to static and dynamic lighting effects can cause automated systems to suffer performance degradation that is not acceptable to the customer.

Conceptual blended-wing/body commercial aircraft also create distortion challenges. In order to fully understand the effects of complex inlet distortions on conventional fan and compressor designs, a range of inlet distortions needs to be processed through the compression system and evaluated for performance impacts. The ScreenVaneTM family of distortion generators provides the necessary testing capability. The technology has been under development at Virginia Tech for nearly 10 years and has advanced to a high TRL. However, acceptance for ground-based engine testing has been limited. To address this issue, Virginia Tech has teamed with Techsburg, Inc. to better commercialize the product. Through their joint STTR Phase I effort, the team identified structural integrity as the primary hurdle to broader acceptance of the technology and quality of the resulting distortion pattern as the second issue. The objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to address both matters. Despite being design to high static factors of safety, analysis of previous test results showed that high-risk applications could lead to failure through flutter. To avoid this potential problem, the Phase II effort aims to develop a safety criteria for preventing flutter, analysis methods to evaluate the criteria and designs methods to insure the criteria is met. The biggest remaining challenge in designing accurate distortion patterns is the impact of structural support screens required for mounting distortion generating screens of ScreenVanesTM. These so called “backer screens” interact with the lower porosity profile-producing screens resulting in a composite loss distribution that remains inadequately modeled. The design system will be extended to accommodate many commonly used backer screen configurations by acquiring experimental data on a range of porosities in combination with the existing portfolio of lower porosity screens, thus, addressing most customers’ needs empirically.",Stephen Guillot,,(540) 381-8502,sguillot@techsburg.com,Stephen Guillot,,(540) 381-8502,sguillot@techsburg.com,Virginia Tech,Todd Lowe,(540) 231-7650,"['model', 'testing', 'failure flutter', 'high-risk application', 'product', 'radar', 'family distortion generator', 'analysis', 'static factor safety', 'face distortion', 'technology', 'performance', 'safety', 'distortion', 'structural support screen', 'customer', 'technology development', 'joint sttr phase', 'criterion design method', 'design', 'quality', 'problem', 'potential', 'distribution', 'analysis method', 'conceptual blended-wing/body', 'compression system', 'structural', 'cross-section', 'capability', 'configuration', 'distortion pattern', 'phase']"

The idea is to use a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a wireless camera and a laser line that can almost fully autonomously fly inside and around the building, video record all the interior and exterior structures, and send the video and other recorded information to the base station where the 3D model is constructed using computer vision techniques. The proposed system requires the development of two innovative technologies: (1) automated construction of texture-mapped 3D models of structures video recorded from a flying vehicle, and (2) autonomous flying of an UAV inside and around a building based on the recorded video and range information. While 3D scanning is an existing technology and small UAVs have already been developed, this proposal will combine these technologies and enhance their capabilities to deliver new value. In addition, computer, smartphone and tablet software for interactive visualization and exploration of the constructed 3D models will be developed. The broader/commercial impact of this project is in the area of marketing of businesses and institutions, virtual reality applications as well as in rescue and law-enforcement applications. Having detailed, photo-realistic 3D models of building interiors and exteriors is useful in a number of applications. However, the existing approaches for the construction of such models are labor intensive and require highly trained people and expensive equipment, which make the entire process prohibitively expensive for most applications. The proposed system would reduce the cost of construction of such models by at least an order of magnitude compared to the existing solutions and would automate most of the process.

(PSI) proposes to partner with clinicians in the Harvard Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery to develop an innovative device for distraction osteogenesis (DO) of the mandible. DO taps the bone regeneration ability of the body to fill a bone gap that is gradually expanded with a mechanical distractor. The concept proposed will use miniature hydraulics to produce a fully buried actuator capable of producing curved distraction trajectories. The device will allow skeletal expansion without linkages that pass through the skin, reduce patient responsibility by automating the motion process, permit clinicians to alter the distraction trajectory as treatment progresses, and reduce distraction time by making the motion nearly continuous. The program will emphasize the ability to make curvilinear distraction trajectories. Several key engineering innovations will make the new distractor possible. These include: micro- and miniature valve technologies, storage of hydraulic energy, a low-power RF link for in vivo programming and control, and multi-actuator design for complex trajectories. In Phase I, PSI will identify solutions to critical technology challenges, build a prototype device, and demonstrate feasibility by implanting it in a porcine cadaver.

There is existing interest in the radar community in the use of chaotic waveforms because of theirsignal characteristics. There is furthermore a perhaps even more important technologically-relevant attribute of these signals that is often overlooked: They are the output of nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems. This means that, for example, theycan be produced by a circuit as simple as a nonlinear Colpitts oscillator. It also means that they can be predicted in time. Imagine two or more radar systems producing signals that are different dynamically, that is, they do not follow the samedeterministic equations. The processors on the two radars should be able to independently track their respective signals. There is no precedent for this application of predictive filter theory, because there is no history of the use of deterministicwaveforms in radar. If this approach can be carried out, we could produce a simple device to replace much of the electronics in the radar signal processor.  The military and commercial potential for an radar signal processing technology that reduces costand complexity, and is capable of operating in real time is enormous. We anticipate that these benefits are within reach, and believe that the application of dynamics-based methods is critical to achieve them. There is also a need for new modulationtechniques that increase flexibility in transmission and reduce receiver complexity. This is of primary concern in multiuser systems. Our proposed modulation technique allows flexibility at a pulse by pulse level, and greatly reduces receiver complexity.The goal is an increase in overall system capacity and spectral efficiency.

Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of the print-based Reading for All Learners Program (RALP) and its precursor, the SWRL little books, as summarized in the proposal. The tablet version of RALP will incorporate a student assessment and monitoring (SAM) system to ensure adequate reading progress, including measures of reading fluency and comprehension, and adaptive instructional recommendations based on student needs. Additionally, the project will incorporate voice recognition software to add a test of reading comprehension and to provide recorded student practice with feedback. Designed for teacher-led instruction with large or small groups, or one-on-one instruction with struggling students at school or home, RALP + SAM will provide instructional prompts for effective teaching and implementation. This Phase I project will investigate feasibility, identify needs and recommendations for a tablet-based adaptation from users of the print-based product, and test tablet-based adaptations and assessment, including voice recognition for reading comprehension assessment. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to students at high risk for reading failure and the need for effective early intervention to reach grade level reading, math, and science goals. On the 2009 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), 67% of students performed at or below the basic level, and only 33% were proficient or advanced (NCES, 2010). According to NAEP researchers, students performing at or below a basic level only have ?partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade.? Recently, Hernandez (2011) found that children who do not read proficiently by third grade are four times more likely to drop out before graduating from high school, and six times more likely to drop out of they have not mastered even basic reading skills. This project develops a cross-platform tablet-based reading curriculum program to assist teachers and caregivers with delivery of effective instruction. This project will build upon the RALP K-3 curriculum.

The conventional optical mouse provides only 2D tracking, and requires battery and a non-reflective patterned surface. New human-machine interface based on video processing such as Kinect is limited by line-of-sight and has high demands of CPU cycles on the host computer. This proprietary technology is the passive harmonic RFID tags that can be localized by the reader in sub-millimeter precision within the 2-4 meter reading range, and can provide 9-bit precision of sensor data by multi-frequency phase detection. The main research tasks include 1) conforming the wireless link to the allowable FCC bands of amateur radio, Bluetooth and/or RFID UHF, 2) investigating multi-antenna technology to reduce the multi-path interference in the harmonic uplink, and 3) developing improved algorithms for the mouse motion tracking to minimize the host reader loads. It will formulate the prototype choices for the passive tags as the battery-free 3D mouse and for the dongles on the host Windows computer as the reader. The broader impact is that many other human-machine interfaces for gaming, prosthesis, and motion tracking can be enabled by this RFID technology, which have large market growth potential as well as social impact on everyday life. The plan on the 3D mouse and other human-machine interface such as game controllers will help obtain the necessary manufacturing expertise, grow revenue, and build business reputation. If 10% of the present wireless mouse users would switch to this battery-free, no-surface constraint 3D mouse, the conservative estimate will be a market size at 40 million dollars with one product alone. With further extension of range, multiplexing and digital ID integration, the real-time locating RFID technology will also have broad applications on building energy management, inventory control, and security monitoring. In addition to the conventional harmonic radar concept to reduce interference, several new concepts in the nonlinear-transmission-line based backscattering tags have resulted in self-matched impedance with various antenna, spectrum spilling prevention, high harmonic conversion efficiency, and high-resolution distance determination by preserving the phase information.

One of the most notable improvements in dose-response assessment - a required quantitative step in risk assessment - is the development of benchmark dose (BMD) methodology to better utilize toxicological information to facilitate toxicity evaluation of chemicals. Although the BMD method has been advocated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for its scientific advantages (such as less dependency on the design of experiments and more plausible interpretation on uncertainty) for years, the employment of the method in practical risk assessment has been significantly hindered by a few important limitations, one of which is the lack of a reliable modeling system to support consistent practice of BMD modeling across different sectors. Therefore, based on the Bayesian benchmark dose modeling system (BBMD) prototype successfully built in Phase I of the STTR project, the objective of Phase II is to further the development of the BBMD system to meet more diverse needs in dose- response assessment and to enlarge the user base of the system as an essential component for commercialization. The rational is that, given relatively limited practical implementation of BMD modeling for dose-response assessment in industry and some government agencies, demonstrating and improving the utility of the BMD method rather than sophisticating the methodology are more appropriate at the current stage to enhance the acceptance of BMD method and then create business opportunities for the company. To accomplish this objective, three specific aims will be pursued: (1) develop a Bayesian BMD modeling approach with software for typical epidemiological dose-response data; (2) develop a Bayesian BMD modeling approach with software for high-throughput dose-response data; (3) upgrade the BBMD to a data computation and management system to perform, store, and distribute BMD analyses approved by a panel of experts. The success of the project will fill multiple gaps that hamper the large-scale adoption of BMD methodology in industry and government. Meanwhile, Dream Tech will increase the influence of the BBMD system and build up user base through an array of channels to commercialize the dose-response modeling platform and services in support of chemical risk assessment.PROJECT NARRATIVE The Phase II of the STTR Project is to further the development of the Bayesian benchmark dose modeling system (BBMD) started in Phase I to meet more diverse needs in dose-response assessment and to fill multiple gaps that hamper the large-scale adoption of BMD methodology in industry and government, which will be a major step forward in chemical risk assessment and safety evaluation for protecting public health from chemical exposure.",KAN SHAO,,(812) 856-2725,shao.kan@outlook.com,KAN SHAO,,(812) 856-2725,kshao@indiana.edu,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,,,"['chemical registration', 'government agency', 'chemical risk', 'bbmd system', 'base bayesian benchmark dose modeling system', 'European Food Safety Authority', 'bmd methodology', 'limitation development', 'sector', 'software', 'modeling system', 'development', 'safety', 'success project', 'multiple', 'NARRATIVE phase', 'project', 'high-throughput dose-response datum', 'exposure', 'step risk assessment', 'employment method', 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'dose-response modeling platform service', 'dose-response assessment', 'safety evaluation', 'information', 'bmd analysis', 'benchmark', 'implementation', 'public', 'required', 'chemical exposure', 'industry', 'response assessment', 'Chemical risk', 'bayesian bmd modeling approach', 'bmd method', 'phase', 'user base array channel', 'user base system', 'phase sttr', 'bayesian benchmark dose modeling system', 'current stage', 'government', 'health']"

Using human donor chondroctyes, we have developed an innovative method for producing what we call neocartilage, a viable, biomechanically stable tissue that we plan to commercialize for the repair of chondral defects in knee joints. Unlike native adult cartilage, which has no capacity for continued growth or repair, the chondrocytes in our neocartilage continue to produce cartilage molecules, resulting in a cartilage tissue that has the potential to repair chondral defects resulting from trauma. In this proposal , we will optimize tissue culture techniques needed for neocartilage production. As a preface to the transplantation studies, we will optimize methods for fixation of neocartilage allografts to the host tissue. In addition, we will evaluate the structural, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of the neocartilage allografts both pre- and post- transplanation in a weight-bearing sheep model. This proposal is unique because it combines biomechanical and biochemical methods of evaluating integrative repair of cartilage defects. We anticipate that upon completion of this proposal, the necessary data will be available to design a pre-clinical study for presentation to the FDA.

This research project will result in the development of a high-performance electrochemical reduction cell for destroying perchlorate to < 5 ppb in drinking water.  The innovation is the use of highly conductive, high surface area ceramics as flow-through electrodes in compact reactors.

When these sub-acute infections are diagnosed and treated appropriately, chronic lung disease patients can convert from moderate/severe to a milder disease phenotype, requiring lower medication to achieve better health at a significantly lower cost. Current gold-standard diagnostics for sub-acute infection rely on decades-old technology that can take weeks to complete, have limited sensitivity, and are limited in the type and number of microbes that can be screened by a single test. Thus, a critical gap exists due to the inability of current diagnostics to comprehensively, quickly, and accurately detect microbial pathogens in low-burden clinical samples, which is a significant barrier to improved clinical outcomes in chronic lung disease. We developed a comprehensive NGS targeted amplicon panel for a) detection and profiling of microbes with associated treatment resistance data and b) profiling human immune system host response genes. Our NGS diagnostics (Dx) panel is a significant technological innovation over current methodology due to the combination of the inherent technical characteristics of a targeted NGS approach, the specific set of amplicons we target and our proprietary laboratory and analysis workflows. The long-term goal of this project is to provide a novel clinical tool for the detection of low-burden microbial infections driving disease pathology, symptomology, and exacerbations in chronic lung disease populations such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and moderate to severe Asthma. Our preliminary studies demonstrate an ability to a) utilize patient samples directly vs. requiring cultures, b) provide orders of magnitude greater sensitivity and accuracy than qPCR or metagenomic approaches, and c) comprehensively screen bacterial, fungal and viral species in a single assay. Our specific aims are designed to test the feasibility of our NGS Dx approach to provide substantial enhancements in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and speed over current clinical standards. The first aim of this study is to establish the limits of detection and specificity of the targeted NGS Dx panel to detect microbial species when most of the DNA/RNA in the sample comes from a human host. The second aim of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the NGS Dx panel to identify sub-acute infections among subjects with severe chronic lung disease. After successful completion of these aims, Phase II studies will build off of these and other early research activities to demonstrate clinical validation and utility in a CLIA certified laboratory, enabling engagement of patient samples for clinical diagnostic testing. The total market for this diagnostic is the set of chronic lung disease patients with uncontrolled symptoms who could be screened for sub-acute infections. Our competitive advantages include vastly improved sensitivity, speed, comprehensive microbe detection, microbe profiling, stream-lined analysis, and treatment effectiveness insights within a single assay.PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-level lung infections that do not exhibit the usual symptoms of a pathogen can be a major source of uncontrolled disease in patients with certain lung conditions, like asthma and COPD. Patients with uncontrolled disease experience significant medical costs, hospitalizations and negative impact on quality of life. The goal of this STTR is to evaluate the accuracy of a new diagnostic test for low-level lung infections in patients with a chronic lung disease, thereby providing treatment guidance to achieve disease control for the patient !",TASHA FINGERLIN,,(303) 803-6445,tefingerlin@gmail.com,TASHA FINGERLIN,,(303) 270-2487,fingerlint@njhealth.org,NATIONAL JEWISH HEALTH,,,"['chronic lung disease', 'treatment guidance', 'immune system', 'laboratory analysis', 'clinical tool', 'qpcr metagenomic approach', 'diagnostic testing', 'low-burden', 'host', 'moderate/severe mild disease', 'detection profiling', 'long-term', 'market', 'sensitivity', 'disease', 'technology', 'moderate', 'diagnostic test', 'low-level', 'technological innovation', 'limit detection', 'sample', 'accuracy', 'medical cost', 'treatment effectiveness', 'project', 'life', 'asthma copd', 'technical characteristic', 'clinical sample', 'host response', 'diagnostic set', 'patient', 'disease pathology', 'detect', 'population copd', 'stream-lined analysis', 'clinical standard', 'disease patient', 'detection', 'quality', 'cost', 'microbe profiling', 'limit type number microbe screen', 'patient sample', 'goal project', 'disease control', 'lung condition', 'low medication', 'clinical outcome', 'sub-acute infection subject', 'clinical', 'phase', 'substantial enhancement', 'symptom control subset', 'health']"

The study of PTMs largely relies on antibodies; however, we have shown that the majority of commercial histone PTM antibodies are plagued by low efficiency and/or low specificity. Antibody quality is of special concern for ultra-low cell input approaches, which require detection reagents to exhibit high on-target epitope binding (i.e. efficiency) with minimal off-target binding (i.e. specificity) to maximize yields from limited inputs (e.g. rare cell populations) and improve assay sensitivity. EpiCypher has begun to address this current roadblock by developing libraries of recombinant designer nucleosome (dNuc) substrates carrying diverse histone PTMs and leveraging this technology to rigorously assess antibody binding specificity and target enrichment. However, some PTM targets (e.g. H4K20me2) and unmodified states (e.g. H3K4me0) remain intractable (i.e. no good antibodies exist), and/or are not suitable for low input studies due to low target enrichment. Thus, new detection reagents are needed to access historically challenging targets and to enable ultra-low cell input approaches, opening new avenues to effectively study biologically relevant PTMs and advance clinical biomarker / drug development.Here, EpiCypher is developing Super Readers™: ultra-sensitive, first-in-class recombinant detection reagents that exhibit increased specificity and affinity (vs. antibodies) to enable 1) detection of historically challenging PTM targets and 2) ultra-low input PTM mapping. Natural chromatin reader domains have high specificity but often display low affinity when isolated. The innovation of this approach is the multimerization of chromatin reader domains, leveraging the avidity effects of multivalent interactions to create high-performance detection reagents. These breakthrough tools will be developed using EpiCypher’s proprietary DNA-barcoded dNuc technology to rigorously validate specificity on physiologically relevant substrates, and to enable cross- sample comparisons in CUTandRUN (Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease), a novel ultrasensitive chromatin profiling approach. For proof-of-concept, we developed a Super Reader, confirmed its specificity on dNucs, and applied it in CUTandRUN, demonstrating its utility and reliability for PTM mapping. In Phase II, we will develop a total of six Super Readers and validate them in CUTandRUN under a range of conditions, including ultra- low cell inputs. Further, we will apply a Super Reader to profile a PTM with no quality antibodies available (H4K20me2), thus creating the first ever accurate genomic map for this mark and characterizing its role in DNA damage repair. Finally, we will optimize manufacturing of the six Super Readers, assemble beta-kits, perform external validation, and integrate these tools for in-house CUTandRUN assay services. Together, this work will lead to the development and commercialization of a new class of high-performance detection reagents that will provide first-time access to historically challenging PTMs and enable ultra-low cell input PTM mapping, thus driving novel epigenetics research and clinical advances that were previously unachievable.",JAMES BONE,,(434) 996-8107,jbone@epicypher.com,ZUWEN SUN,,(919) 448-7268,zwsun@epicypher.com,,,,"['dNuc technology rigorously', 'Super Reader profile', 'histone ptm leverage technology', 'high-performance detection reagent', 'natural chromatin reader domain', 'detection reagent', 'input', 'cutandrun range', 'gene expression', 'on-target epitope', 'sensitivity', 'innovation', 'manufacturing', 'input approach', 'project', 'low', 'binding', 'sample comparison cutandrun', 'first-in-class recombinant detection', 'first-time', 'low cell', 'unmodified state', 'detection', 'quality', 'post-translational modification', 'input study', 'multimerization chromatin reader domain', 'class high-performance detection reagent', 'off-target', 'Super Reader', 'lead development', 'ultra-low cell', 'Super reader ™', 'ultra-sensitive', 'clinical', 'phase', 'Super reader', 'efficiency', 'in-house cutandrun', 'drug development']"

Lack of end-to-end encryption has been a growing problem for consumers, educational institutions and businesses collaborating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will advance the state-of-the-art by providing developers with the necessary tools to create high quality synchronous collaborative virtual environments where children, teachers, corporate professionals and even national security personnel can safely engage in work-activity without risks of privacy loss or security/data compromises. This will also benefit telemedicine where privacy is paramount from a personal perspective and also from a legal standpoint. The success of demonstrating end-end encryption for a high-performance application will result in other remote-work collaborative tools being designed with end-end security as a key feature. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project solves the problem of maintaining end-end security of content while allowing expressivity using a scripting language by separating the data plane from the control plane for such massively collaborative multimedia applications. The control plane can be programmed using a web-friendly language that can be executed on any existing user-device such as laptops/smartphones thus giving maximum portability to the app developers. The data plane always stays end-end encrypted and can be manipulated using the scripting language in a highly expressive manner. The system provides perfect forward and backward secrecy by using a fast-group rekeying protocol to maintain confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the multimedia content. Research and development on this project will lead to breakthroughs in multiple avenues including the demonstration of a truly high performant decentralized end-end encrypted application. This will spur the demand for end-end security for any remote-work collaborative application.

The program includes three parts.  1. A plan will be developed and implemented to facilitate the operation and to manage the growth of the JUMPS. This plan will leverage Virtual Machines (VMs), which abstract applications from the hardware on which they run.  Hardware changes and growth will be achieved with few or no modifications to the VMs and their applications.  Furthermore, VMs will improve application availability and will provide fault tolerance.  2. A new class of application tool will help the JUMPS program address the diverse requirements of a large number of user agencies. Each agency will tailor&quot;minion&quot;apps within the constraints of a common JUMPS software library.  Minions will be delivered to host sites where they&quot;look after&quot;the interests of the agency. Minions address the issue of limited bandwidth by improving peripheral access to central resources.  3. A management tool will optimize system performance while considering potential attacks, thereby improving survivability beyond the level provided by the enterprise virtualization tools.  This management tool is necessary because the U.S. Army faces a substantially greater threat environment than a typical enterprise organization.  The method differs significantly from typical approaches to network optimization because the potential actions of adversaries are considered.  Accurate Automation will virtualize the JUMPS in a way that manages growth, including the diverse requirements of an expanding user-base, thus minimizing programmatic risk, while simultaneously addressing the severe threat environment in which the U.S. Military operates, thus minimizing physical risk.

The proposed broadband AR coating is based on a multilayer architecture of low-refractive index polymer and high-refractive index polymer or polymer hybrid materials.  High quality polymer films can be deposited by resonant infrared pulsed laser deposition (RIR-PLD) method while polymer composite films can be deposited by resonant infrared matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) and their combinations.  Model material systems will be designed and compared by appropriate mathematical modeling.  Optical transmission, reflection and scattering will be measured with standard optical metrology techniques.  The flexibility of RIR-MAPLE and RIR-PLD allows the deposition of a wide variety of materials including chemically resistant (insoluble) barrier polymers and nanoparticles embedded in polymer matrix to enhance durability and engineer the refractive index.  A hybrid scheme with RIR-MAPLE and RIR-PLD along with a multi-target carousel further enlarges the palette of materials that can be deposited in vacuum for achieving unprecedented optical and mechanical coating properties.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated result of the proposed approach is an environmentally durable AR coating on polymer substrates.  Specifically, the outcome of this project will allow the deposition of adherent and non-delaminating coatings onto polymer surfaces.   If proven successful, it is possible to enhance significantly the quality of AR-coating on widely used plastic substrates, as more than a half of population wears corrective eyewear and/or sunglasses.   In addition, the outcome of this project will have a proof of concept for commercialization of this novel technique for thin-film organic opto-electronics devices such as organic light emitting diode (OLED) and light management films for displays.

Traditional stratospheric balloons are massive and difficult to operate. They are often hundreds of feet tall, weigh thousands of pounds, costs tens of thousands of dollars, must be launched from fixed locations in near-perfect weather, and are always one-time use. These technical, operational, and financial limitations have led to a largely underutilized stratospheric environment. The first proposed research objective for this effort is the design completion of a small, mobile-launch, durable, and fully reusable altitude stable stratospheric balloon. The second research objective is the design and development of advanced balloon flight trajectory software needed to identify acceptable balloon launch sites that yield successful, targeted remote sensing missions. The third objective is the development of a rapid, mobile-launch platform. The project will culminate with a stratospheric flight test campaign that may demonstrate the combined system innovations, measured by the system’s overall ability to image pre-determined target areas of interest at specified times.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance stratospheric remote sensing technologies while enabling safe, routine, and commercially-viable Earth observation from a stratospheric balloon platform. The stratosphere is relatively void of commercial remote sensing activity, largely due to the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons. Today, stratospheric balloons are commercially unviable for remote sensing applications due to their inability to image specific areas of Earth at desired times, largely due to constraints associated with the need for fixed launch infrastructure, a lack of system directional control, and narrow operational launch windows requiring restrictive launch weather conditions. The novel stratospheric remote sensing balloon that is the subject of this effort may reduce or eliminate many of these constraints, resulting in a zero-emission, mobile-launch, precisely-placeable stratospheric remote sensing balloon that will enable high-resolution, targeted, low-cost Earth observation.

We aim to produce a moderately doped (1E13-1E16) thin buried gain layer (~4-6 micron) using graded epitaxy on a high resistivity bonded substrate. Current state-of-the-art is a proposed sensor design of low to moderate gain (x10-50) reach through silicon avalanche diodes (LGADs) to achieve ~10 ps time resolution for collider experiments. The current generation of reach-through diodes suffers from large fractional dead area at the edges of the pixel (>50 micron), poor spatial resolution, and only moderate radiation hardness. The standard LGAD is a “reach through” diode - a deep moderately doped p “gain” implant though a shallow, highly doped n-type anode. When depleted, the ionized dopant atoms generate a gain field in the reach-through region. The field depends in density and distribution of dopants. In this process, radiation removes donors and creates acceptors, which modifies the field in the reach-through region, ultimately eliminating gain. A moderately doped thin buried (~4-6 micron) layer replacing a reach-through implant can address some of these problems. The epitaxial layer can be made well defined thinner gain layer and denser than the reach-through design with the same number of dopant atoms, hence improve effect of radiation. The substrate construction would be based on Cactus Materials, Inc. developed vacuum wafer bonding techniques with oxide free interface (silicon to silicon direct bonding) and commercially available standard epitaxy layer. The dopant concentration and depth of epitaxial layers will be varied along with bonding interface characterization to optimize the performance of the substrates (i.e. charge collection). The characteristics can be tuned by adjusting depth and density of the epitaxy. “AC coupled” buried layer will solve edge problem and make design simpler. In the AC coupled LGAD the prompt signal is coupled through a thin oxide layer to the pickup electrode. The sheet resistance of the anode implant and coupling capacitance has to be tuned to provide the proper output pulse shape, neighbor signal, and DC coupling to ground.",Mohammed Islam,,(480) 213-4704,rafiqul.islam@cactusmaterials.com,Mohammed Islam,,(480) 213-4704,rafiqul.islam@cactusmaterials.com,,,,"['grade epitaxy high resistivity bond substrate', 'bond interface characterization', 'coupling capacitance', 'implant shallow', 'poor spatial resolution', 'shape', 'signal couple thin oxide layer', 'density distribution', 'epitaxial layer', 'moderate', 'reach-through design number dopant atom', 'radiation remove donor create acceptor', 'performance', 'process', 'implant', 'gain field', 'neighbor signal', 'time resolution', 'layer solve edge problem design', 'output', 'n-type', 'doped', 'charge collection', 'design', 'pulse', 'epitaxial technique', 'vacuum wafer bonding technique', 'reach-through implant address problem', 'ac couple', 'radiation hardness', 'effect radiation', 'silicon avalanche', 'ac couple lgad prompt', 'bonding', 'depth density epitaxy', 'epitaxy layer', 'silicon', 'stability', 'sheet resistance', 'direct bonding']"

Recent work has demonstrated that miRNA expression profiles may be diagnostic of cancer and other pathological states. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a versatile microarray platform to profile miRNA levels in research and in diagnostic settings. These arrays incorporate molecular beacons as self-reporting constructs, thereby facilitating rapid analysis of samples without the necessity of labeling. The Phase I work proposed here will explore the design and specificity of molecular beacons for miRNA profiling. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop the principles of molecular beacon probe design and selection for quantitative profiling of miRNAs. Molecular beacons will be designed with a variable-length stem sequence, and constant recognition sequence. The recognition sequence will be designed to recognize target miRNAs and DNAs derived from these miRNAs by reverse-transcription and PCR amplification. By varying the stem length, molecular beacons will be obtained that recognize the same sequence with different affinities. Such sequences will be tested and optimized to selectively report on the presence of specific miRNAs, over a range of concentrations and temperatures. 2) To determine the optimum slide surface, linker combination and microarray format for the functional attachment of miRNA molecular beacons. Molecular beacons in array studies have suffered from a high fluorescence background. A novel bimolecular beacon construct that acts as a self reporting probe will be tested for its ability to dramatically enhance signal to background fluorescence. In addition surface and linker chemistries will be rationally optimized in order to maximize performance. 3) To develop a prototype molecular beacon array to profile miRNAs, and to selectively discriminate between miRNAs differing in a single nucleotide. The prototype array will be used to determine, in well-defined synthetic test samples, the absolute concentrations of closely related members of the let-7 family of miRNAs. This highly homologous family has several family members that differ by a single nucleotide, and hence represents a stringent test of our technology. In phase II of this project, we intend to design and optimize self-reporting chips and devices that will quantitatively profile the full range of human miRNAs in biological samples. The public health relevance of this work is that this technology will facilitate basic research on cellular processes and provide insight into the molecular origins and progression of human diseases. These tools should ultimately lead to robust and reliable devices for the molecular analysis and monitoring of disease, sensitive and specific diagnostic tests and ultimately to the discovery and development of new therapies.",LESLIE BEADLING,,(732) 470-6970,LBEADLING@RATIONALAFFINITY.COM,WILLIAM BRAUNLIN,,(732) 418-9039,bbraunlin@rationalaffinity.com,PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,,,"['molecular beacon array', 'probe test', 'prototype molecular beacon array profile', 'linker chemistry', 'applicant', 'diagnostic cancer', 'phase work', 'temperature', 'long-term', 'monitoring disease', 'self-reporting', 'technology', 'surface', 'diagnostic test', 'selection quantitative profiling', 'performance', 'development', 'signal background', 'prototype array', 'project', 'recognition sequence design', 'biological', 'sequence', 'variable-length stem sequence', 'single nucleotide', 'quantitatively profile', 'sensitive', 'principle molecular beacon probe', 'rapid analysis', 'design', 'constant recognition sequence', 'functional', 'labeling', 'cellular process', 'molecular beacon', 'molecular beacon self-reporting construct', 'molecular origin', 'research', 'fluorescence background', 'public health', 'therapy', 'fluorescence', 'human disease', 'linker combination microarray format', 'stem', 'phase', 'device', 'molecular beacon design', 'sequence test', 'synthetic test sample', 'array']"

Protecting groups for nucleobase substituents involved in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding will be identified and used to block hybridization. Subsequent removal of the thermolabile group at elevated temperature for 10-30 minutes, and as part of the genomic method, will release the desired nucleic acid and allow the genomic method to be initiated under controlled conditions of time and temperature. The technology is expected to eliminate non-specific reactions and false readings caused by mis-matched hybrids, primers annealed to non-target template, mis-priming, and partially complementary primers at ambient temperature. The primary objective is to prevent premature or erroneous formation of hybridized nucleic acids during sample preparation procedures that lead to undesirable events of sequence recognition. The specific aims are (1) development of chemistry for reversible, thermolabile, covalent modification of nucleic acids and (2) preparation and characterization of modified nucleic acids suitable for specific genomic methods. Nucleosides and small nucleotides will be used as model compounds to investigate candidate chemistries and the kinetics of deprotection. These chemistries will be applied to and evaluated with oligonucleotide primers, genomic DNA, and nucleoside triphosphates. This project will result in a new class of compounds and technology for health related applications in genomic methods such as SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis and allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization which are the basis of DNA microarrays, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing applied to medical diagnostics and health related research. Commercial applications include modified nucleic acids, specialty chemicals, and new instrumentation for utilizing the technology in probe based diagnostics, health related research, and pathogen detection.

The management of bacteria in wounds is complicated by the existence of multidrug-resistant strains and mutants.  Therefore, novel modalities for preventing and treating wound infections, one of which may be highly purified and characterized bacteriophage preparations, are required.  Lytic phages (i.e., bacterial viruses that infect and lyse their specific bacterial hosts) have been used to treat bacterial infections since their discovery during the first decade of the 20th century.  However, their therapeutic use gradually declined in the “Western World” after the advent of antibiotics.  At the present time, there is renewed interest in phage-based prophylactic and therapeutic approaches because phages are active against multidrug-resistant, pathogenic bacterial strains and mutants.  Our current application proposes to develop a potent lytic bacteriophage preparation/cocktail against A. baumannii – a major wound pathogen of particular concern to the US Army, and an increasingly important public health problem.

The proposed project will develop a microbial inoculant that will rapidly and efficiently transform post-harvest leftover plant matter into a nutrient-rich bioavailable fertilizer used to nourish future crops, particularly in the emerging hemp industry. The findings from this research project are potentially applicable to the degradation of other common agricultural crops, such as corn, and the conversion of feedstock into biofuels. The technology will add value to farms, save farmers money, and prevent further environmental harm through the production and use of synthetic fertilizer. This SBIR Phase I project advances a cooperative, synthetic microbial inoculant that degrades lignin, a polymer in hemp that is highly resistant to degradation, into a nutrient-rich fertilizer that increases hemp yield. This innovation will be achieved by developing and performing assays that quantify the efficiency with which microbes degrade lignin and produce peroxidases, the family of enzymes that degrade lignin. After identifying microbes with lignin-degrading capabilities, these microbes will be incorporated into a plant growth promoting co-culture, at which point the inoculant will be optimized to achieve the maximum lignin degradation efficiency at a wide range of temperatures and conditions. This will be achieved through lab-scale adaptation, i.e. a natural forced microbial evolution. Finally, the output of the optimized microbial inoculant will be evaluated for its ability to increase hemp seed germination and decrease the harmful effects of plant pathogens.

The Air Force needs calibration solutions that reduce these timelines and increase sensor throughput. Our proposed solution follows a successful model of combining the best of open source, peer reviewed astrometry tools with government developed analysis and modeling codes to build a cohesive application that performs self-calibrated photometry based on stars serendipitously observed within the field of view. Our proposed SPOSAT (Self-calibrated Photometry using Open Source Astrometry Tools) system leverages an existing interactive analysis framework that guides users through the process of performing source extraction, blind astrometry, and photometric calibration, automating its steps to process SSA imagery and produce calibrated photometry measurements suitable for use by other analysis tools. SPOSAT also will integrate modern star catalogs, including UCAC4 and NOMAD, to inform our astrometry, source/star correlation, and sensor calibration modules, and will use all available metadata from the input images to optimize the astrometry and sensor modeling computations. This working prototype application will lay the groundwork for integration into existing SSA data pipelines in Phase II and beyond.  BENEFIT:  Techniques developed in this proposal move towards the goal of completely automated photometry, and will be broadly applicable to organizations and individuals operating both astronomical and space situational awareness telescopes. These techniques will allow for the rapid creation of new photometric data pipelines that improve the ability to test and demonstrate new systems, and could eventually be incorporated into extremely mobile sensor platforms. Government, academic, and amateur astronomers will all benefit from a means to automatically produce calibrated photometry measurements, and these developments will dramatically increase the availability of high quality calibrated photometry data for research as well as for validation of state of the art analysis techniques. Incorporating this technology into highly autonomous satellite platforms could benefit builders and users of those systems as well: calibrating photometry onboard can enable the systems to better inform the onboard decision making process, leading to greater autonomy and more effective missions, as well as to improve responsiveness and reduce bandwidth requirements by transmitting only calibrated photometric data to the ground rather than entire image frames.",David Myers,"Director, Program Controls",(877) 763-8268,djm@stellarscience.com,Birch Polega,Senior Software Developer,(877) 763-8268,birch@stellarscience.com,,,,"['model', 'source/star correlation', 'modeling computation', 'effective', 'input image', 'calibration', 'cohesive application', 'step process', 'photometry datum', 'photometry onboard', 'solution', 'user process', 'individual', 'peer review', 'validation state', 'analysis', 'sensor calibration module', 'bandwidth requirement', 'primary collection', 'reference', 'photometry', 'measurement', 'technology', 'star image', 'application', 'self-calibrated photometry base star', 'ability test', 'metadata', 'development', 'astrometry tool government', 'integration', 'photometric calibration', 'throughput', 'Self-calibrated Photometry use open Source Astrometry Tools', 'mobile sensor platform', 'Techniques', 'availability high', 'field view', 'analysis tool', 'modern star catalog', 'image frame', 'research', 'system', 'decision making process', 'source extraction', 'organization', 'situational awareness', 'government', 'mission']"

Hemodialysis (HD) enables blood to be withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of the failed kidneys. This process must be repeated at regular intervals and thus requires repeated, high flow access to circulating blood. Adverse events due to mode of access and device failure are frequent, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars per year and leading to significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Currently, no technology on the market addresses dialysis graft needle injury or graft material degradation due to needle trauma. The proposed device will minimize injury levels and decrease the probability of serious complications for chronic HD patients. The proposed Phase II SBIR project will advance a technology for prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) for hemodialysis.

By combining the advantages of the electrochemical capacitor solid polymer electrolyte and the electrolytic capacitor, the proposed design will yield a high voltage, small volume and low Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) device with simplified packaging process, Besides the potential for volume and/or mass reductions, which will significantly contribute to the clinically important efforts of reducing the size of the presently implantable defibrillator, other inherent characteristics of hybrid capacitor could be critical drivers for selection of this technology for implantable defibrillators. Incorporating the solid electrolyte would eliminate any possibility of electrolyte leakage, thus enhancing reliability, life and safety of the proposed hybrid capacitor, which will have a significant impact on selection of this technology. During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed concept of the solid polymer electrolyte hybrid capacitor was clearly demonstrated. For Phase II it is planned to extend the investigation to identify methods for further modification of the internal anode structure by increasing its surface area to gain higher capacitance. It is planned to optimize and standardize processes and designs, to build stacks, evaluate capacitor housing and encapsulation materials and procedures, to perform long-term stability and reliability tests, and to study and select sterilization and packaging options. Phase 11, and Phase Ill work related to product development and production preparation tasks will be performed together with a capacitor company working with customers in the ICD and heart-support field.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The commjercial  potential of this application is significant, there is critical need for reduced size, high energry density capacitor for the implantable defibrillators, in addition these technologies are needed to open up a significant opportunity for making other implantable support devices, i.e., for nerve and muscle stimulation.

To protect the vessel walls from cavitation erosion, helium micro bubbles can be added to the mercury to act as attenuators of the pressure waves and to minimize cavitation effects.  A diagnostic method is needed to monitor the gas injection technique and to measure the bubble size distribution.  This project will develop an acoustic diagnostic tool that can meet the bubble size and void fraction requirements of the Spallation Neutron Source application.  To enable use of larger amplitude acoustics waves and overcome excessive damping in the bubbly mixture, a non-linear acoustic theory and an intelligent artificial neural network using a priori knowledge from the acoustic theory will be used to extract bubble size distribution from acoustic data.  Both acoustic wave transmission and reflection methods will be investigated and used to enable measurement at a range of void fractions that are often encountered in two-phase flow applications.  During the Phase I study, significant progress was made in extending the capabilities of the acoustic bubble spectrometer hardware for a wider range of bubble sizes and void fractions, and in adapting it for the DOE mercury application.  A non-linear bubble dynamics model that extends the linear theory utilized in the present spectrometer was developed and demonstrated.  The feasibility of using a neural network based inverse problem solver to measure bubble size distribution was demonstrated using both synthetic and experimental data.  The feasibility of using reflection waves to measure bubble size distribution and void fraction was also demonstrated; and theoretical formulations to interpret reflected sound wave signals to use in the inverse problem solver development were initiated.  In Phase II the hardware of the spectrometer will be further improved to upgrade high frequency signal generation (for smaller bubble size measurements) and lower frequency hydrophones (for large bubble size measurement); and better designed integrated hydrophone for reflection tests.  This will enable development of high fidelity databases for training and validating the neural network based spectrometer.  The 3-D nonlinear acoustic model will be expanded to simulate practical geometries encountered in spectrometer operation and provide databases for training and testing the neural network in regimes where linear acoustic theory does not apply.  Finally, the acoustic reflection method initialized in Phase I will be further developed, tested, and implemented in the new generation acoustic bubble spectrometer being developed. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A marketable acoustic instrument capable of measuring a wide range of bubble sizes and void fractions will be a valuable tool for diagnostics and control of numerous multi-phase flow and liquid metal applications.  Successful development of the proposed instrument will have wide commercial and scientific applications and benefits.

New algorithms will be based on a fully kinetic description of plasmas such that electrons, ions, and/or neutrals will be individually tracked with proper weighting techniques applied. The computational approach will be based on Monte Carlo methods which will be combined with XccelerateTM, Remcom's particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite integration (FIT) solver currently under development. Taking into account the limitations of the current methods available, a comprehensive list of relevant plasma/gas and plasma/surface chemical reactions will be constructed to form a foundation and scope of the project. Research code will be developed to study the accuracy and computational expense of the combined PIC/FIT/Monte Carlo solver. If the computational expense proves prohibitive, parallelization and hardware acceleration techniques will be investigated. The Phase I project will determine the feasibility of implementing a plasma processing code which provides computational solutions for a wide range of plasma discharge and processing applications.  The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be the creation of simulation software for plasma processing. Plasma processing is widely utilized in the manufacturing of semiconductors and integrated circuits as well as being a critical component of material science and nanotechnology applications. These fields will continue to expand in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, even after many years of research, the theoretical understanding of plasma processing lags behind the practical application, and industry relies largely on trial and error techniques in determining their manufacturing processes. The overall goal of the project is to provide plasma processing physicists with a comprehensive software package which will provide a full range of numerical solutions with an easy to use graphical user interface (GUI) and powerful result visualization capabilities. This contribution will allow industries to streamline their operations by increasing theoretical understanding prior to the manufacturing stage and reducing man-hours spent developing complex in-house computational algorithms. In addition, it is also expected that the completed project will receive attention from various government research labs and provide an excellent tool for academic teaching and research.

From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using nanoparticles that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility throughout the global supply chain. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting. The system is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion intensity when using low excitation power densities.

These novel waveforms can be adapted to meet mission requirements and offer low Probability of Intercept (LPI), jammer resistance and reduced surveillance time-lines. We plan to focus on practical issues related to transmitting and processing these waveforms in Phase I. We will leverage the CERFER testbed that is being developed by KEYW for AFRL for a demonstration flight or laboratory experiment in Phase 2. TSC has broad experience in VideoSAR and exo/endo-clutter GMTI processing techniques from its work on the AFRL Gotcha, DARPA ViSAR and other programs. TSC has developed an innovative Optimized Waveform Generator that will be used to refine the baseline orthogonal phase-coded LFM waveforms to overcome transmitter distortions. In Phase I, our team will refine the baseline waveforms explored by other researchers, develop a flexible real-time processing architecture, address radar hardware limitations, and prepare a demonstration flight test plan. Analysis and computer simulations will be used to accomplish the work in Phase I with the express goal of conducting a hardware experiment in Phase II. BENEFIT:These diverse waveforms will enable simultaneous SAR and GMTI surveillance modes and offer low Probability of Intercept, jammer resistance and reduced surveillance time-lines for aircraft conducting surveillance or ground attack missions in contested environments.

Randolph Street, Suite 200",,Chicago,IL,60661,"Subsurface processes play a central role in the nation’s energy system. Over 80% of the United States’ total energy consumption is supplied by energy resources extracted from the ground. These processes include both emergent and environmentally sustainable components of our energy system such as unconventional oil and gas production, enhanced geothermal systems, and carbon storage. These emerging energy system components rely on multiphysics, multiscale phenomena, and tight coupling between multiphase flow, thermal transport, geomechanics, and geochemistry of the subsurface. One of the main challenges in the design and implementation of these subsurface energy technologies is that detailed physical processes spanning these scales are difficult to detect and measure accurately. Numerical experimentation may be a valid substitute for some lab or field experiments. However, the computational expense to resolve the physics at the relevant scales may be prohibitive without access to large computing clusters and a rigorous, scalable, high-fidelity, computational framework. Fitila Technologies will develop a commercial software platform around an advanced numerical simulator, funded by DOE, that has a framework capable of resolving the known physics in subsurface energy processes. Then, equip the simulator with enabling technology and methods, such as deep learning surrogate models and uncertainty quantification toolkits, to accelerate time-to-solution and increase utility of simulator in practical engineering workflows. The software platform will include a graphical user interface to increase accessibility and will provide access to on-demand, cloud-based, computational resources. Phase I efforts will focus on setting up the infrastructure to increase accessibility and adoption of the simulator. Specific tasks in Phase I include: 1) developing native Windows binaries for the simulator and porting the code to the cloud; 2) developing physics-informed deep learning surrogate models to accelerate time-to-solution; 3) developing uncertainty quantification workflows and integrating toolboxes capable of uncertainty quantification, parametric analyses, and global sensitivity analyses; and 4) developing the requirements for a feature-rich, user- friendly, intuitive, and fully functional graphical user interface. If successful, the proposed project will facilitate innovation in the hydraulic fracturing industry and yield a step change in our understanding of how to produce energy efficiently and sustainably from unconventional resources. Computational efficiency and prediction accuracy offered by the platform will allow designers of carbon storage and enhanced geothermal system projects to evaluate a myriad of design options and associated risks to guide these initiatives towards commercial viability. The proposed software platform will also help further DOE’s other responsibilities such as advancing radioactive waste disposal solutions. A core part of this project’s value proposition is democratizing the use of high-fidelity numerical models. One of the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program mission objectives is to develop capabilities that enable innovation and scientific discovery through computation.

This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in perceiving and understanding the complexity of real world objects.One common problem shared by past development efforts of a number of 3D volumetric display mechanisms is that although the concepts can be demonstrated using the proof-of-concept prototypes, it is very difficult to scale-up to actually produce a full color, full resolution and full size 3D volumetric display systems, due to many inherent limitations of these concepts.We believe that it is extremely important to develop a 3D volumetric display concept that is inherently Scalable.  Large size, full color, and full resolution 3D display system can be built using mechanisms that do not have serious problems in scale-up production.  The primary objective of the Phase I SBIR program proposed herein is to investigate a novel concept of generating high resolution, full color and large size true 3D volumetric images and producing scalable 3D display systems.  Besides the ability to produce high resolution full color true 3D volumetric 3D images without need of viewing glasses, additional advantages of the proposed 3D display method are large angle of view, simultaneous multiple user views, large viewing volumes, flexibility in voxel size and shape, high voxel bandwidth and inherent parallel scanning architecture.In this Phase I SBIR effort, we will investigate the feasibility of the proposed 3D display concept.

Normalizing superoxide production, by supplemental superoxide dismutase e.g., eliminates the increases in advanced glycation end-products, protein kinase C activity, sorbitol concentration, and hexosamine pathway flux. It has therefore been proposed that supplemental antioxidants which interrupt the overproduction of superoxide should have therapeutic value against a wide spectrum of diabetic complications, including glomerulosclerosis, multifocal axonal degeneration, retinal ischemia, etc. While copious in vitro studies on both natural antioxidants (Vitamin E, a-Lipoic Acid, etc.) and synthetic antioxidants (ebselen, supoeroxide dismutatse mimetics, etc.) have demonstrated the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, clinical studies using supplemental natural antioxidants are far less conclusive. There are needs for both additional testing of antioxidants in cell cultures under hyperglycemic conditions and new antioxidant molecules that catalytically remove superoxide rather than merely scavenge one superoxide molecule per antioxidant molecule. Recently, a new class of synthetic antioxidants has been shown to be exceedingly effective at preventing mortality in mouse models of other disorders arising from increased oxidative stress. It is believed that the effectiveness of these new antioxidants arises from both a favorable cellular distribution and a catalytic mechanism for the deactivation of superoxide. This project will determine whether members of this class of antioxidants can extend their previous successes to afford protection of cells during hyperglycemic conditions, as well as to confer their benefits for retarding the microvascular complications arising from streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. The significance of the proposed work lies in the development of a new class of potent antioxidants suitable for mitigating the debilitating complications associated with diabetes. As diabetes is expected to affect over 17 million people in the USA alone by 2010, the impact of a sufficiently potent antioxidant that prevents or drastically reduces the complications arising from diabetes would have a broad impact on public health.",JOHN WRIGHT,,(303) 940-2300,jdwright@tda.com,MICHAEL DIENER,,(303) 940-2314,MIKEE@TDA.COM,,,,"['therapeutic value', 'testing', 'protein kinase c activity', 'condition', 'applicant', 'synthetic antioxidant', 'cellular distribution', 'clinical study', 'development', 'retinal ischemia', 'project', 'effectiveness', 'synthetic', 'advanced glycation end-products', 'mortality mouse model', 'wide spectrum', 'public health', 'oxidative stress', 'protection']"

The memristor devices can be formed in the interconnect layers of a conventional IC so that the area available for underlying transistors is not affected. This approach results in a 3D architecture achieved using a single substrate without the need for bonding multiple die together with flip-chip or through-silicon-via technologies. Furthermore, the memristor devices are much smaller than single transistors for any given technology node, and will scale to smaller dimensions as IC technology continues to progress towards smaller and smaller transistor sizes. The two-terminal memristor devices have numerous advantages including on/off conductance ratios greater than 104, reversible and fast switching, long retention times and immunity to current-induced degradation. In addition, their inherent simplicity makes them highly compatible with Si-based microelectronics technology, leading to a 3D architecture that can be readily transferred into semiconductor products at the most basic, integrated circuit level.  BENEFIT:  The memristor is of great interest to the Department of Defense (DoD) since it can potentially revolutionize numerous analog and digital circuit technologies. Specific Air Force applications that would benefit from this technology include tunable RF circuits in software defined radios, delta sigma modulators, and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Furthermore, memristors can theoretically be used to simulate the human synapse, making them useful for non-Boolean, neuromorphic computing, which is an attractive computing technique due to its massive parallelism, scalability, and inherent fault-tolerance.  Such neuromorphic computers could lead to game changing capabilities in managing and exploiting the global information grid, as well as enabling revolutionary advancements in cyber information processing and “cloud computing,” which requires an IT infrastructure of hundreds of thousands of servers and storage systems. The memristor can also be used for nonvolatile memory. Applications include radiation hardened devices for space-based surveillance platforms, launch vehicles and miniature kill vehicles for the MDA ballistic missile defense system; integrated sensor systems for imaging sensors used for automatic object identification and target recognition; friend or foe identification; and theater threat assessment. The DoD is aggressively developing robotic technologies for unmanned and totally autonomous air, ground, and sea vehicles which require a multitude of sensors and high-speed, high-density, low-power memories for obstacle detection, identification, and avoidance, as well as the recording, compression, decoding, and real time image processing of imaging sensor data.",Glenn Mortland,President,(512) 633-3476,glenn@privatran.com,Burt Fowler,Principal Investigator,(512) 431-8460,burt@privatran.com,Rice University,,,"['real time image processing', 'analog-to-digital converter', 'decode', 'infrastructure', 'fault-tolerance', 'space-based surveillance platform', 'identification', 'autonomous air', 'two-terminal memristor device', 'low-power memory obstacle detection', 'circuit', 'flip-chip through-silicon-via technology', 'sensor system imaging', 'friend foe identification', 'manufacturing', 'memristor device small single transistor technology node', 'technology', 'neuromorphic computer', 'robotic technology unmanned', 'long retention time', 'three-dimensional', 'high-density', 'layer', 'server storage system', 'fast switching', 'information processing', 'bond multiple die', 'scalability', 'theater threat assessment', 'nonvolatile memory', 'current-induced degradation', 'compression', 'on/off conductance ratio', 'transfer semiconductor product', 'packing density advanced', 'avoidance', 'level', 'target recognition', 'parallelism', 'computing technique', 'memristor device', 'non-boolean', 'automatic object', 'si-based microelectronic technology', 'sea vehicle', 'capability', 'neuromorphic computing', 'architecture', 'global information grid', 'ballistic', 'newly-developed manufacturing method', 'recording', 'analog digital circuit technology', 'cloud computing', 'radiation harden device']"

In our new approach, visualizations will be automatically generated based on user-defined goals, data set characteristics, and first principles in cognitive science.  This will be a systematic and rigorous process, in which various visualization techniques are evaluated based on their utility for the current user goals and data set, as well as the compatibility of their underlying cognitive premises.  The key innovation in our system is the explicit inclusion of all of these factors in an automated design process through the use of taxonomies for cognitive principles, visualization techniques, and user-goals.

The Linearity Error Compensation (LinComp) technology provides dramatic improvements in dynamic range, whichenables very accurate conversion at high IF or RF frequencies.  By eliminating stages of RF downconversion or upconversion, these technologies greatly accelerate the progress toward direct digitization or synthesis of wideband data directly at the antennaelement.  The breakthrough in converter performance afforded by the AFB and LinComp technologies will be demonstrated by developing fully-functioning prototypes combining these technologies.An open architecture prototype system will be developed provide a versatile platform to rapidly develop, test, and integrate the very latest converters using these technologies;  target specifications include: 1) 12-bit ADC with 1.6 GHz sample rate (withdirect sampling up to 800 MHz IF or RF); 2) 14-bit ADC with 800 MHz sample rate (with direct sampling up to 400 MHz IF/RF); 3) 16-bit ADC with 400 MHz sample rate (with direct sampling up to 200 MHz IF/RF); and 4) 14-bit DAC with 2 GHz sample rate (withdirect digital synthesis up to 1 GHz IF/RF)In addition, a very compact prototype AFB ADC system will  be developed for demonstration in the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) digital beam former (DBF) array or other system to test the AFB and LinComp technologies in an operationally relevant environment; thissystem will be designed to provide beyond state-of-the-art, extremely high speed and high resolution analog-to-digital conversion in a very compact package.Very importantly, the AFB and LinComp technologies have been specifically designed to avoid obsolescence because they can both be easily upgraded as new individual converters become available.  This Phase II project is based upon two successful SBIR PhaseI projects demonstrating the technical efficacy of these technologies in working lab breadboards.  Numerous commercial and government entities have pledged a total of $490,000 of financial support for matching funds for this project;  these entities willalso provide technical support to help develop the technologies and a strong customer base for the commercialization in Phase III.The AFB and LinComp technologies overcome the critical analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion bottleneck whichlimits performance of state-of-the-art radio frequency transceiver systems.

Though it is the method of choice for many         rheumatologists, Enzyme-Linked Immuno-sorbent Assays (ELISA) have become a more      common immunologic procedure, in part due to cost considerations. Attempts to        lower the cost of IFA by automating the readings are problematic due to poor         photostability and high non-specific binding of the fluorescent dye. Recently,       Hyperion, Inc. has introduced a system for automating preparations of IFA            slides and has developed La Jolla BlueTM, a near-infrared-emitting, photostable      dye with low nonspecific binding, that allows automation of all steps of the         IFA.

Communities participating in the AQEarth program will make use of three technologies developed successfully in three different SBIR projects – two from NIH and one from NSF. The Personal Air Monitor (PAM) allows students and other community members to measure the air pollutants CO, CO2 and particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5) along sidewalks, inside their homes, schools and workplaces and inside vehicles like cars and buses. A Mobile Air Pollution Sensors (MAPS) monitor will be developed here to upgrade our current CarTopper for measurements of five Criteria Air Pollutions – CO, PM2.5, O3, NO2, SO2 – along with CO2, the primary tracer of combustion and the most significant greenhouse gas. Accurate low-cost, sensor-based measurements of NO2 and SO2 will be made possible by the novel use of ozone generated by UV light as an internal standard to reduce sensitivity drift (an innovation likely to be patentable) and the use of a zeroing scrubber to cancel baseline drift. MAPS will enable mapping of these air pollutants throughout a city with high spatial resolution using a combination of community vehicles such as parents’ cars, buses, trams and city service vehicles. The third SBIR-developed technology that makes mobile measurements using low-cost sensors possible is AQSync, a fixed- base monitoring station containing highly accurate miniaturized instruments. The AQSync will serve both as a walk-by or drive-by reference station for maintaining the calibrations of the low-cost mobile sensors of the PAM and MAPS and as a long-term monitoring station for determining the diurnal, day-to-day and seasonal variations of air pollutants at that location.The AQEarth program will be deployed in three U.S. cities (Ft. Collins; CO, Anchorage, AL; Atlanta, GA), one tribal area (Navajo Nation, NM), and one international city (Mexico City) over a period of three years. This will allow us to gain experience with cities having a wide range of climates, a tribal jurisdiction, a community where environmental justice advocates will participate (Atlanta) and an international city. The program will be continuously improved as we gain experience with cities/tribes with widely different challenges. The AQEarth is a collaborative project with TD Environmental Systems, LLC, a leader in applications of air quality sensors, and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment, where the highly successful Love My Air program was developed. The final deliverable will be a replicable community-based program for air pollution measurements coupled with education about air quality and its health effects and discovery of actionable knowledge that can be used to reduce exposure to air pollutants and improve human health.",JEANIE MCPHERSON,,(325) 235-5494,jmcpherson@ludlums.com,JOHN BIRKS,,(303) 273-0559,johnb@twobtech.com,,,,"['low-cost', 'K-12 educational outreach program', 'community vehicle', 'spatial resolution', 'calibration', 'reference station', 'personal air Monitor', 'monitoring station', 'student', 'long-term', 'sensitivity', 'innovation', 'technology', 'sensor-based measurement', 'development', 'aqearth program', 'CO', 'project', 'environmental justice', 'co2 particulate matter', 'exposure', 'day-to-day', 'air pollution', 'collaborative project', 'mobile sensor', 'maps', 'PAM', 'quality', 'knowledge', 'leader application', 'implementation', 'Environmental Systems', 'community-based program', 'location', 'community-based air monitoring program small town', 'trams city service vehicle', 'sbir-developed technology mobile measurement', 'climate', 'personal exposure', 'vehicle', 'mapping air', 'Air Pollution sensor', 'greenhouse gas', 'health effect', 'couple education', 'experience', 'health', 'program']"

Our technology enables significant improvements in analysis speed, non-invasiveness, device automation, and marked reduction in logistical burden and operating cost.

Experiments were undertaken to demonstrate microfluidic stem cell manipulation and impedance identification of the cell differentiation state, which firmly established proof-of-concept of the technology. In Phase II, efforts will focus along two directions. First, an advanced cell sorter will be developed for separating cells of different characteristics. Design optimization and experimental characterization will be carried out for enhanced performance. Second, the microfluidic stem cell analyzer will be integrated with COTS component technologies to develop an integrated prototype for automated operation. The functionality of differentiation state identification and cell sorting will be extensively demonstrated using human iPSCs progressing along various lineage commitment pathways.

This hydrogen will be produced from hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Nearly 8 million tons of H2S are processed by the energy industry each year. Sulfur recovery units (SRUs) are used to safely manage H2S. SRUs utilize an old Claus process and are unprofitable because of high capital and operational costs, in addition to low revenues due to sulfur overproduction. In contrast to the Claus process, H2S plasma dissociation recovers sulfur and hydrogen, whereby the sulfur can be used for oil desulfurization or as a commercial product.Dissociating H2S in plasma and producing hydrogen will make SRUs profitable and will reduce the industry's carbon dioxide emissions.

This project addresses important national and worldwide challenges related to the mobility of people who use wheelchairs (4 million in the US alone), which is continuously jeopardized by many daily challenges. Through the development of an affordable and ready-to-use aftermarket accessory capable of increasing the height of manual wheelchairs, the project is oriented towards a more equal, inclusive, and accessible society. The proposed technology will dramatically boost the self-confidence of people who use wheelchairs by enabling face-to-face conversations and improving their productivity at work. It will increase their independence by allowing them to reach surfaces and spaces that were previously out of their reach. At the same time, the new solution will reduce injuries resulting from tips and falls due to unsafe reaching from their wheelchair. Users will save costs associated with injuries and expensive home retrofits. Finally, the proposed technology will represent a huge opportunity for employers because of increased productivity for their workers with disabilities and dramatically reduced costs adapting the work environment and providing ""reasonable accommodations"", as required by law. The proposed project seeks to explore the feasibility of solving height-related problems among all people who use manual wheelchairs with an electronic and affordable device that can be retrofitted on all standard ultralight wheelchairs, balancing crucial factors such as weight, height of lift, and ease of operation. The proposed Phase I activities will generate the first functioning prototype capable of serving as a proof-of-concept for testing and future commercialization. Engineering efforts will be first dedicated to the selection and integration of hardware components and to the development and deployment of the device control software. A sensor-based control scheme will be implemented to enable a safe, smooth, and fast lift experience. Once the hardware is assembled and the firmware is deployed, the new device will be tested in laboratory settings to ensure that, when it is attached to a standard wheelchair, it does not alter the wheelchair's stability. This is an essential prerequisite not only for future FDA approval, but also to make the device ready for future testing (Phase II) with volunteers and, more generally, to enable its commercialization as a universal aftermarket accessory.

Plane mirrors have understandably been the mainstay of acoustic and optical reflecting surfaces because of their ease of manufacture and their simple reflection physics. We challenge this current paradigm, and we propose instead that such imaging systems can be based upon novel reflecting surfaces. The proposed surface is the functional equivalent of a classical plane mirror, in that it contains all the desired angular variation that occurs upon movement of a mirror. Whereas a moving mirror requires use of a complex position-feedback control mechanism, the proposed structures can be powered by nothing more than a simple motor operating at a constant rotational frequency. This conceptual advance allows the creation of a new category of endoscopes that are simple to build, easy to manufacture, less expensive, and thus commercially attractive. In Phase I, the development and testing will proceed on first-iteration prototypes based on two major configurations that utilize the novel reflecting surface technology. In addition to imaging system testing with standardized object and tissue phantoms, we shall explore other applications, e.g., a forwardlooking biopsy device. In Phase II, we develop a commercial prototype, and demonstrate its efficacy and safety in experiments on animals and humans. In addition to the stated benefits of functional simplicity and reduced cost, the novel surface technology may allow the equipping of inserted instruments, which are limited by a view-blocking component at the front end of the device (e.g., forceps of a biopsy device), with a capability that allows them to image around the component. Hence, screws, needles, and other insertion devices could be so equipped with such a side-stepping forward-imaging capability.

One means to achieve this goal is to devise rugged thin-film coatings for vulnerable copper surfaces, providing a higher work function than copper alone.  This project will evaluate a variety of candidate thin-film coating materials for inhibiting field emission in high-power microwave components and develop recipes for applying these coatings to copper test blanks.    Phase I will develop a variety of thin-film materials, including the possible use of intermediate adhesion layers and outer anti-oxidizing layers, for application to copper test blanks.  An X-band test cell will be designed to achieve a microwave electric field strength on the coated test blanks that is more than double the field strength on other surfaces in the test cell.  A non-high-vacuum model of the test cell will be built and cold-tested.  Ultimately, comparisons will be made between the thresholds for microwave breakdown (as well as the rates of breakdown above threshold) in coated and uncoated test blanks; the difference in performance of the various coating materials also will be examined.

Current Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) and Lattice Beyond Standard Model (LBSM) simulations require four orders of magnitude greater computational rates to reach this level. Heterogeneous hardware can provide orders of magnitude improvements in computational rates but presents significantly more complex code development and porting challenges. The project will develop the capability for optimizing LQCD software bases in particular the heavily templated QDP++ data parallel libraries through an interactive control and visualization interface for advanced software optimization technologies.  The approach will leverage the polyhedral model for precision of dependence analysis and increased range of optimized mappings. Phase I research and development (1) demonstrated capabilities for recovering high-level array semantics from the templated software base by overloading templates in the QDP++ library (2) developed a visualization and control interface within the Eclipse Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for polyhedral parallelization and optimization. (1) Implementation of translation tools interfacing heavily templated LQCD libraries to polyhedral mapping (2) application of the tools to current theoretical physics simulations related to testing Standard Model (SM) theories (3) development of new optimized solver algorithms for LQCD (4) development and quality improvements.

Managing the consumption and storage costs of these critical power systems, and developing unique energy assurance projects that can be replicated across the Air Force, are essential to maintaining advanced levels of mission readiness and resilience, while significantly reducing costs.  The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), is host to the Energy Directorate (CN), tasked with delivering secure, sustainable and efficient energy solutions so that installations have the resources they need to execute their missions. AFCEC/CN collaborates with the AF Materials Command's (AFMC) Installation and Mission Support Center (IMSC), on several major activities including Mission and Energy Assurance (MEA), Power studies for backup systems and uninterruptable power supply, and survivability through resourcefulness. These organizations represent key USAF stakeholders for Nanoramic's high-density energy storage devices.  Nanoramic® Laboratories is developing the next wave of electrode technology to dramatically improve the performance of batteries and ultracapacitors. Their proprietary Neocarbonix™ electrodes are demonstrating major advances in Li-ion energy storage devices, enabling high-energy and high-power density Li-Ion batteries and capacitors with long cycle life and wide temperature ranges (-55 to 85 ºC). The high-performance Li-ion battery/capacitor energy storage devices are designed and manufactured by special capacity ratio design of binder-free cathode/anode electrodes, ultra-thin lithium anode electrode pre-lithiation method, wide operating temperature electrolyte, and optimized test formation processes.  The manufacturing process for the Neocarbonix™ electrode-based Li-ion energy storage devices can save up to 20% in $/kWh of the cost compared with conventional Li-ion battery manufacturing process. Simply put, Nanoramic® products provide greater power, energy density, and performance in extreme environments compared to traditional battery designs. Battery and supercapacitor manufacturers utilize Neocarbonix™ to optimize their production process, to support product growth, to reduce cost, and to increase compatibility with any active material. During this Phase I project, Nanoramic will contact AFCEC's Energy Directorate (CN) relevant divisions (CND/CNR), and AFRL's Advance Power Technology Office (APTO) and Direct Energy Directorate, in order to gather use cases and align with the needs and goals of current power efficiency development project.

Typically, the collected data are displayed and evaluated as a set of two-dimensional images through the organ or diseased area under investigation. SPECT allows qua ntitative study of the function in the investigated region and therefore is an extremely useful tool for understanding organ and tissue physiology including that in the heart. SPECT is very commonly used in identifying as well as localizing coronary artery  disease and as many as 90% of all myocardial perfusion studies are now performed using SPECT. Thus, SPECT is playing a critical role in cardiac imaging, providing both diagnosis as well as prognosis. However, there is urgent need for improvement in the in strumentation that is currently used for this imaging modality and expand its capabilities in order to exploit its full potential. At present, the performance of SPECT systems often is limited by the detectors used in these systems. Modern SPECT systems co nsist of scintillation crystals coupled to photomultiplier tubes as detectors. Important requirements for scintillators used in SPECT applications include high light output and high energy resolution, reasonably fast response and high gamma ray stopping ef ficiency. Ideally, the scintillator should also be inexpensive, rugged and easy to manufacture. Currently, NaI(Tl) is the detector of choice in SPECT systems and it is relatively inexpensive and its light output is fairly large. However, the poor energy re solution of NaI(Tl) often limits SPECT performance. The energy resolution of NaI:Tl is limited by its relatively poor proportionality. If scintillators with higher energy resolution at typical SPECT energies (~140 keV) were available, the essential process  of scatter rejection would improve. Furthermore, dual-isotope imaging, which is a unique property of SPECT, would also become possible if scintillators with high energy resolution became available. The goal of the proposed effort is to investigate a new h igh resolution detector for SPECT studies. Enhanced scatter rejection can be expected along with possibility of dual isotope imaging. The Phase I project will be aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed concept, while the Phase II project wil l be aimed at optimization of the new detector, implementation of the prototype module and detailed performance evaluation.

As storage, memory, and processing speeds increase there is a push to evolve morecomplex software systems.  This push arises from the desire to utilize untapped computational potential. Complex software development, however, is constrained by a bottleneck facing the industry.  The bottleneck is not a hardware bottleneck a la vonNeumann, but rather a bottleneck of expertise. Software development requires skilled software engineers with experience designing and implementing large software systems. Unfortunately, the demand for these engineers far exceeds the supply, and thebottleneck will only narrow as demand increases. Our solution is to reduce the role of the software engineer in the development process.  This means increasing the role of the SME, which also means increasing the role of tools for assisting the SME.Since development is evolutionary in nature, SMEs will need tools for not only new development, but also for the adaptation of software.

Stroke is        one example. In this context, availability of medical devices can enhance            medical care to the patient.                                                                                                                                              Blood cell counters, which are used to count blood components such as red and        white blood cells, are ubiquitous in medicine as a diagnostic aid for disease        identification or as a general tool for many medical therapies. The pre-eminent      device in use today is the Coulter counter, which is expensive, large, and           generally not portable, requiring at least a desktop, household current supply       and a small support laboratory. The goal of this research and development            project is to design a prototype miniature blood cell counter for home-care, or      point-of-care analysis in doctors' offices, clinics, and hospitals.                   The novel blood counter we propose to develop is based on new, emerging              micromachine technologies, and would be approximately the size of a small            cell-phone, requiring very low electrical power. Similar to an inkjet print          head, which is also a product of micromachined fluidics technology, the core         analytical components of the miniature blood counter would be inexpensively          mass-produced. The cost per unit would be low enough that the analytical             portion could here placed after each use.                                            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed device has several likely economic advantages.  Firstly, it will reduce the  need for and cost of transport of blood samples to centralized laboratory.  Secondly,  expedient diagnosis will mean fewer clinical complications fewer office visits, shorter  hospital stays and possible a reduced need to transport patients.

These sources typically employ radioactive sources such as 137Cs, which presents a significant safety and proliferation hazard due to its long half life (30 years). Furthermore, these sources typically use cesium chloride, a water-soluble crystalline salt, which makes them particularly dangerous in a radiological dispersion device (“dirty bomb”). These concerns limit the applicability of gamma-ray logging due to the limits imposed on the source. Technical Approach This project will develop an innovative, ultra-compact, cm-wave linear accelerator with a novel microwave power source, both of which will be 3” in diameter to fit into even the smallest of production casings. The proposed eXtra Compact Linac (XCL) tool consists of a rugged system containing a novel microwave RF source serving also as the electron injector for a novel, cm-wave accelerating structure. Insensitivity to the harsh environmental conditions is achieved by using wide bandwidth, brazing-free, copper-coated ceramic structure. Phase I Plans In Phase I, the XCL system will be designed and feasibility to replace as much as 2.5Ci of 137Cs will be demonstrated. A mockup of the key, high-risk elements of the system – the generating/accelerating structure – will be experimentally tested. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits The borehole logging industry will grow from an estimated $15.58 billion in 2014 to reach $25.46 billion by 2019. Using a bottom up sizing approach, RBS estimates the initial market for replacement borehole logging equipment totals 1,000 units. With an average selling price of $300- 400k per unit, RBS estimates the replacement market to be $2 billion. In addition to the potential commercial success of this product, the XCL will improve the safety of oil exploration activities and reduce the risk of diversion of radioactive sources for terrorist purposes.

Securing these plants is an on-going expense that typically accounts for 7-12% of the total cost of power generation. Furthermore, research suggests that 20% of the entire workforce is comprised of physical security related personnel. To ensure that future nuclear energy production from advanced reactors is affordable, safe, and secure, new methods should be examined to optimize security using a realistic representation of the adversary’s ability to perform tasks in a combat environment. During SBIR Phase I, research was completed into integration methods for the Risk Informed Timeline (RIT) software and the data it produces. In support of this research, limited scope performance testing was conducted at an NRC-licensee to collect the necessary experimental data and develop distributions of probability of success for a specific breaching technique employed at exercises frequently across multiple NRC-licensee sites. These experimental random distributions were used to generate data files using the RIT software that were ingested into a prototype plugin module for use in a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) combat simulation. To illustrate the value of this data and prototype, the modeling and simulation tool was used to generate security metrics and a comparison was made for several attack scenarios from one of the NRC-licensees. To support this preliminary study, simulation results were compared for a set of attack scenarios where in one case the conservative assumption that all breaches succeeded 100% of the time and in the other the risk informed method applied random distributions to determine the likelihood of success for each of the relevant breaches. Additionally, a variant of each of the related scenarios was created that included reduced protective force posts. The results indicate there was a positive impact to the security system effectiveness and a reduction in the depth of penetration into the security layers that was measurable even for defensive strategies with fewer officers and thus lower operational costs. Phase II will focus on creating a production-quality and commercialized plugin module that works with the existing COTS modeling and simulation tool suite. Additionally, the RIT approach will be expanded from one task type in the prototype to include several more types of player tasks and actions in the COTS tool suite. This module will allow for industry specific performance data to be incorporated as a library of task times and probabilities of success. A commercialization of this tool, in combination with the COTS combat simulation, will allow existing and advanced reactor designers to develop a security strategy that is based upon realistic performance data for complex tasks that will likely result in lower operating costs.",Matthew Talbot,,(703) 850-8281,mtalbot@rhinocorps.com,Dan McCorquodale,,(505) 323-9836,sdmccor@rhinocorps.com,,,,"['data file', 'post', 'nuclear energy production', 'nrc-licensee site', 'operational', 'rit approach', 'personnel', 'physical security', 'attack', 'security strategy', 'rit software', 'production-quality commercialize', 'prototype plugin module use commercial-off-the-shelf', 'market', 'operating cost', 'software datum', 'simulation', 'type player task action COTS tool suite', 'performance', 'SBIR phase', 'security', 'effectiveness', 'security layer', 'security system', 'random', 'probability', 'penetration', 'secure', 'cost', 'depth', 'electricity', 'research complete integration method', 'distribution', 'research', 'experimental random', 'modeling simulation tool', 'environment', 'industry', 'method', 'breach', 'phase', 'library task time', 'module', 'exercise', 'metric', 'time risk']"

This patent pending system differs in three ways form other anaerobic systems now being tried: First the substrate to control PH in the digester for hydrogen production will be a waste product: second the digestion and hydrogen production will be high rate and third the process will involve a continuous flow through system rather than a sequencing batch system. The leftover organics from hydrogen production, mainly volatile fatty acids can be converted to methane, which is also a fuel. The key advantage of the process is that hydrogen gas can be made from inexpensive organic materials that are renewable and sustainable using inexpensive hydrogen-producing bacteria. Despite its clean and green nature when utilized in fuel cells and other devices, most hydrogen is currently produced primarily from non-renewable sources, such as natural gas, oil, or coal. The purpose for this proposal is to obtain funds to replicate the successful production of pure hydrogen in the lab where synthetic manure was used; to using agricultural waste products that have little or no value.

In phase I, the volatile organic compound xylene was successfully detected in water at 100 parts per billion through near-infrared absorption signatures, on chip with 300 micron long photonic crystal slot waveguides which represents the best results in device sensitivity and in miniaturization. The device combines slow light effect in photonic crystal waveguides with highly concentrated optical field intensity in a low index slot at the center of the photonic crystal waveguide. The photonic crystal slot waveguide proposed herein provides a factor of 1000 reduction in interaction length compared to conventional waveguides leading to enhanced optical absorption by analytes in the optical path. Transmission is measured from multiple waveguides covering the entire near-infrared wavelength range, and absorbance determined by measuring transmission differences in the presence and the absence of any volatile organic compound analytes of interest. The miniature spectrometer will enable massively parallel identification and high throughput analysis. The broader impacts of this research are the enabling of continuous, remote, in-situ monitoring and unique identification of multiple volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater, drinking water, and waste water, with high sensitivity and specificity, a facility that is not available commercially at present. The integrated silicon platform ensures low cost production in high volume. From commercial standpoint, the United Nations Environment Program estimates the global water market to expand to $660 billion from the current $250 billion by 2020. The proposed photonic crystal slot waveguide device can be expected to occupy a significant position in this market. The generalized design of the proposed versatile technology implies possible implementation in multiple areas of in-situ analyte sensing, detection, and spectroscopy such as control of food, air, and water quality and health, in a lab-on-chip platform with low cost of ownership. Through continuous, in-situ and remote monitoring, the prototype developed from this research will eliminate the lag time that currently exists in industrial water monitoring, sometimes extending to few months as in VOC monitoring of rivers and lakes, thereby enabling early warning of spurious leaks and spills instead of after-the-fact damage control and mediation and thus enhance environmental and national security.",Swapnajit Chakravarty,,(512) 996-8833,swapnajit.chakravarty@omegaoptics.com,Swapnajit Chakravarty,,(512) 996-8833,swapnajit.chakravarty@omegaoptics.com,Stub,,,"['water', 'spectroscopy control food', 'near-infrared wavelength range', 'remote', 'volume', 'crystal waveguide', 'lab-on-chip platform low', 'optical field', 'identification', 'photonic', 'market', 'sensitivity', 'technology', 'multiple', 'optical absorption analyte', 'project', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'photonic crystal slot waveguide device', 'transmission', 'health', 'detect', 'organic compound water', 'water quality', 'design', 'detection', 'waste water', 'absorption spectrometer', 'throughput analysis', 'cost', 'implementation', 'United Nations Environment Program', 'in-situ', 'industrial', 'monitoring', 'water monitoring', 'global water', 'photonic crystal slot waveguide', 'research', 'sensing', 'environmental', 'slow light effect', 'continuous', 'phase', 'device', 'silicon', 'photonic crystal waveguide', 'near-infrared absorption signature', 'optical path']"

Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute have developed an innovative combinatorial treatment strategy of Local Chemo Radiation Therapy  LCRT  using a modified brachytherapy spacer platform in the form of a INCeRT  ImplaNts for ChemoRadiation Therapy  spacer loaded with Docetaxel  DTX  to locally radiosensitize the prostate  enabling a synergistic cure with the use of lower radiation doses  thereby leading to less rectal radiation toxicity and minimal chemotherapeutic systemic side effects  These new INCeRT spacers are physically similar to the inert spacers routinely used in prostate brachytherapy but now loaded with formulations of DTX which can be tuned to release the drug payload from a week to several months  The technology has been exclusively licensed to TheraNano LLC for commercialization and translation to the clinic  The phase   project goals will be achieved through the following specific aims  Specific Aim    Development  scale up and quality control of docetaxel loaded INCeRT brachytherapy spacers  Develop INCeRT brachytherapy spacers loaded with DTX with analysis of quality control  reproducibility  drug loading and drug release using optimized SOPs  Earlier work at Northeastern University has produced INCeRT spacers in batches of andlt     Here  we plan to scale up the process to routinely manufacture DTX INCeRT spacers in batches of several    s in GLP conditions  The study design will include setting up a pilot plant for fabrication  characterization of INCeRT spacers loaded with docetaxel and quality control assessment in terms of reproducibility  size  drug loading and release kinetics under GLP conditions  Specific Aim    In vivo therapeutic efficacy of combined Chemo Radiation treatment and toxicity assessment in Prostate cancer models  We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of INCeRT spacers combined with Brachytherapy EBRT by locally implanting the spacers at the tumor site in PCa animal models  We will also assess gross immunotoxicity associated with the combined treatment PROJECTNARRATIVE TITLE  Drug eluting Brachytherapy Implants for Chemo radiation Therapy This STTR phase   project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of drug eluting brachytherapy implants for Local Chemo Radiation Therapy  LCRT  as a new modality of prostate cancer treatment  LCRT combines radiation therapy with chemotherapy delivered locally to the prostate  utilizing drug releasing spacers similar to those currently used in brachytherapy  to boost the overall treatment efficiency while greatly reducing toxic side effects  The treatment has the potential to improve the lives of all of the thousands of men with localized prostate cancer who are treated each year with radiation therapy,SRINIVAS SRIDHAR,,(617)

The innovations of the proposed MF-CRA system consists of:  (i) meta-cognitive radio engines that learn which Cognitive Engine (CE) is more appropriate to provide the adaptation needed for the application scenario; and (ii) robust, computationally efficient RF sensing, signal detection, and classification algorithms compliant with the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture and specification.

To this end, we propose to develop and demonstrate the meta-CE concepts tailored for STRS applications where a meta-CE autonomously manages and controls its STRS radio waveforms and their communication parameters configurations. Our meta-CE features a dynamic RF mapping module, which will sense and record the RF signal levels as a function of the coordinates of the transceivers, the earth's atmospheric conditions, space weather, and trajectory of the transceivers so that it can anticipate the signal changes and seamlessly switch among the available links, waveforms, and parameter configuration settings.

The growing need for renewable energy sources will likely drive wind farm construction rates to increase over time. Energy department estimates indicate 2.3% of the current US electric energy supply is supplied by wind and estimates this to rise to 20% by 2030, representing an increase of nearly 10x the number of wind turbines. Wind-turbine induced clutter is fundamentally different from typical ground clutter in that the rotating turbines appear Doppler shifted to the radar in the same way as airborne moving targets. Moreover, wind farms present the radar system with a relatively high density of false targets.   STR&quot;s proposed approach to wind-turbine induced clutter mitigation is based on statistical characterization of the clutter followed by adaptive filtering to simultaneously suppress the clutter and preserve target responses. This approach is designed to address the problem of multiple turbines in a single range cell in which case the clutter characteristics are significantly more complicated than the range-isolated turbine case.    BENEFIT:  If the proposed Phase 1 approach is successful a software upgrade path for existing ATC radars can be designed that mitigates wind farm interference. This upgrade will allow for construction of wind farms near ATC radars without concerns for significant performance degradation.",Mark Luettgen,President,(781) 756-8083,mark.luettgen@SystemsTechnologyResearch.com,Mark McClure,VIce President,(703) 493-0057,mark.mcclure@SystemsTechnologyResearch.com,Stub,,,"['mitigation', 'Doppler shift radar', 'ground clutter', 'interference', 'wind-turbine', 'software', 'range-isolated turbine case', 'performance', 'radar system', 'estimate', 'construction rate', 'characterization', 'degradation', 'atc radar', 'rotate turbine', 'density false', 'problem', 'surveillance', 'wind', 'construction', 'adaptive filtering', 'electric energy supply', 'phase']"

With a good rejection         rate, about 25 times, and reasonably large solid angle, sub-millimolar               concentration can be routinely accessed. However, the performance of the             detector is still lagging behind the photon flux and brightness increases at         the third or even fourth generation synchrotron sources. With more than 100 to       1000 flux increases at the third generation source, these sources would permit       detection of metal concentration in the order of 10 micro-Molar or several ppm       range. This will allow the monitoring of some biologically relevant metals in        vivo. Thus we propose to develop x-ray fluorescence detector using synthetic         multilayer pairs. With two-stage rejection of primary and secondary                  multilayers, it is anticipated that the rejection rate will exceed 200 times.        With a 20 percent throughput, the anticipated gain on the effective count rate       can be as high as 40 times on dilute systems. Initial evaluation shows that the      detector can be made tunable in a wide energy region and to cover a large solid      angle. The major goal for the Phase I project is to design and fabricate a           prototype multilayer pair detector. The test and evaluation of the detector          performance will aid in the design of a multilayer pair analyzer array               detector. Phase II project will develop such a detector to a product.                PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The need for a very sensitive and high count rate x-ray fluorescence detector is well  justified.  The instrument will be vital to x-ray spectroscopy and micro fluorescence   imaging on biological systems under high flux and dilute situations.  With ever increasing  photon flux at the new synchrotron sources, the detector will have a better market   potential than fluorescence ionization chambers and the solid state detectors which are  currently available.", ,,(215) 386-1912,KZHANG@AOL.COM,KE ZHANG,,() -,,,,,"['dilute system', 'biological system', 'high count rate x-ray fluorescence detector', 'vital x-ray spectroscopy', 'synthetic          ', 'application', 'fluorescence ionization chamber solid state detector', 'performance', 'x-ray fluorescence         ', 'count rate', 'project', 'throughput', 'x-ray fluorescence detector', 'metal', 'sensitive', 'Verbatim Applicant Abstract', 'design', 'detection', 'detector product', 'time', 'monitoring', 'potential', 'rejection rate', 'detector market', 'micro fluorescence    ', 'phase']"

The system will be used to rapidly triage patients with chest pains by measuring multiple cardiac marker (CM) concentrations. The system will have use in emergency departments, doctors' offices and ambulances for the rapid identification of patients with ACS, and will reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, reduce hospital costs, and prevent the inadvertent release of patients with ACS. The system will improve on currently available POC CM tests by providing rapid and economical methods of quantifying multiple CMs using a portable instrument format. This will significantly improve the efficiency of CM testing, by allowing CM measurement in ambulances, doctors' offices and patients' homes, as well as convenient bedside testing in hospital emergency departments. The system comprises of two parts, a disposable electrochemical assay strip, and a hand-held device for reading and quantifying the assays. The key innovation in the proposed work is the application of rapid and convenient flow-through assay formats, combined with electrochemical biosensors that allow sensitive multi-analyte quantification. The specific aims of the Phase I are to fabricate proof-of-concept electrochemical immunoassays and demonstrate their use in simultaneously quantifying two important CMs in serum samples, myoglobin and troponin I, in serum samples.

However, the reality is that time, travel and cost barriers prevent most teachers from receiving face-to-face skills-based curriculum training and the practice that instructional mastery requires. Training delivered via the World Wide Web or CD-ROM, eliminates the time, travel cost and practice barriers to effective curriculum training. Many current online educator trainings are limited in their effectiveness to teaching knowledge, but not instructional skills, while skills are necessary for effective curriculum implementation. Through innovative development of online training for instructional skill acquisition is the opportunity for high quality modeling, skill discrimination, and practice. Further, training sections can be repeated, even during curriculum implementation. This project will develop Teachin' it REAL (TIR), a skill-based online training to prepare middle school teachers to implement KIR with comfort, confidence, skill and fidelity. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the online training to prepare teachers to lead KIR with fidelity. Teachers (225) from throughout California will be randomly assigned to one of three experimental training conditions: 1) online training, 2) one-day training, and 3) no training. Teacher comfort, confidence, skill and fidelity while implementing KIR will be measured. Phase I found that teachers and administrators had interest in online training, (specifically CD-ROM) and schools had the technology needed. A prototype was developed to prepare teachers to lead a key activity using one of the essential educator skills to effectively lead the curriculum. A national sample of teachers found the prototype useful and effective. Phase I demonstrated that online teacher training for KIR was technologically, instructionally, and commercially feasible. We expect the teachers in the online training condition to implement KIR with greater fidelity than the one-day and no training teachers.

The glycan components of saliva have been shown to play important roles in biological and immunological aspects of oral host-microbe, microbe- host, and microbe-microbe interactions, and we have shown that glycans attached salivary glycoproteins can act as a first line of host defense in the human mouth and that glycan recognition contributes to both colonization and clearance of oral microbes. A revolutionary innovation in studies of protein-glycan interactions was the glycan microarray, which permitted the identification glycan ligands for biologically relevant glycan binding proteins (GBP) by their simultaneous interrogation with hundreds of glycan structures printed on a microscope slide. Comparisons of the structures of bound and non-bound glycans reveal the glycan specificity of GBP, and this information is used in further biological studies to understand the biological function of GBP. In this project we will generate a glycan microarray composed of glycans that represent the salivary glycome, i.e. the entirety of glycans in saliva. This will be accomplished by first producing a library of purified, naturally occurring N- and O-linked glycans released from 10 liters of pooled human saliva by an innovative process for the Oxidative Release of Natural Glycans (ORNG) using simple household bleach. The library of glycans will be printed as a glycan microarray and interrogated with oral streptococcal glycan-binding adhesins to identify their corresponding natural high-affinity glycan ligands. We will use our recently established toolbox of streptococcal serine-rich-repeat protein adhesins that each contain sialic-acid-binding Siglec-like domains of differing specificity for subtypes of sialic acids in the wider context of their underlying subterminal glycans. For some of these lectins, the natural glycan ligands were not identified using currently available arrays, presumably due to the absence of their corresponding natural glycan ligands presented in the assays to date. Since these are lectins expressed by oral microbes, we anticipate that there is a high probability that their natural glycan ligands will be present in the glycome of human saliva, the natural biological fluid in which these microorganisms thrive. This Phase I project should provide an example of how a complete glycome can be used as a discovery platform for identifying a novel protein-glycan interaction. Once the details of the structure of the glycan ligand are defined, the information will become intellectual property that will lead to strategies to therapeutically interfere with microbial colonization or pathogen infection in the mouth and beyond. This platform for understanding the interactions of oral microorganisms and extraoral systemic pathogens with the human may ultimately lead to the development of an improved artificial saliva, more closely mimicking the glycan landscape of natural human saliva, as addition of human milk oligosaccharides has laid the groundwork for improvement of infant formula.",DAVID SMITH,,(610) 764-4740,natglycan@gmail.com,DAVID SMITH,,(610) 764-4740,dfsmith@natglycan.com,,,,"['non-bound glycan', 'biological study', 'biological fluid', 'host', 'identification', 'structure', 'innovative process', 'critical interface', 'mouth', 'glycan structure print microscope slide', 'project', 'biological', 'intellectual property', 'probability', 'information', 'human milk', 'phase project', 'high-affinity glycan', 'artificial', 'lead development', 'sialic-acid-binding siglec-like domain', 'oxidative release', 'glycan component', 'biological function', 'array']"

Any DC cryogenic flow system such as turbo Brayton, Joule-Thomson (JT), or remote cooling applications require very high effectiveness heat exchangers to reduce input power. The parasitic loads from heat exchangers are a significant fraction of the overall load, and high effectiveness heat exchangers lead directly to improved system efficiencies across a broad range of cryogenic applications.  Microplate heat exchangers have a demonstrated effectiveness over 98% (Marquardt, Cryocoolers 15). While performance is high, they will be difficult to use for larger cryogenic flow systems due to parasitic conduction losses inherent in the materials available for the manufacturing process. A material change will allow more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic losses. Other limitations of the manufacturing process make yields low, and while it may be possible to push the effectiveness higher, it may be difficult to consistently produce high performing exchangers using the current approach.  We propose a new bi-metal microplate heat exchanger which is unique in that it uses the manufacturing process to control critical heat exchanger dimensions that are inherently similar across all parts, allowing high effectiveness without the need for close inspection of every part and the low yield which results from hand inspection. We further include additional features within the flow channels that automatically balance the mass flows within the heat exchanger to push the effectiveness even higher.

They are rugged and reliable and can be left in the field for a long period of time after deployment.  To improve the spatial resolution for separating multiple closely spaced targets that move in tight formations while reducing the on-board computational requirements,  a modest quantity of single microphones could be deployed in a surveillance area of interest.  These microphones are considerably less expensive, small sized and contain generic DSP boards capable of performing simple detection, feature extraction and data compression tasks. They are also equipped with basic communication systems to transmit essential compressed target information to a master station which has more sophisticated computational power to carry out high-level operations for sensor array processing and target detection, tracking, and classification.

The extracted subband features would allow for detection and preliminary classification of the targets in time-frequency as well as data compression and encoding.   In this framework, only essential frequency and tonal target features that are needed for accurate target localization and classification will be encoded and transmitted, thus yielding a low bit rate without incurring degradation in the overall detection, tracking and classification performance.

Ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide are generally considered the limiting hazardous gas compounds for animal operations. Elevated levels of air contaminants can cause immediate and long term health effects. Short term effects include eye, nose, or throat irritation, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. The treatment of short term symptoms can be as simple as isolating the affected person from the contaminated environment. Successive short term exposures, however, can lead to various chronic diseases, including asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Long term effects, which usually occur from cumulative exposures over a long period of time, can result in respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, and can be severely debilitating or fatal. Current state-of-the-art sensor systems have limited accuracy and high false alarm rates. They are also hampered by high power requirements, making real-time gas sensor analysis impractical. Conventional mass spectrometric and gas chromatography systems, such as the Trace Gas Analyzer and the Volatile Organic Analyzer, are expensive items whose high power requirements and large mass restrict their use in wide air monitoring applications. Relevant studies on air quality measurements, based on gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, have been used to detect and identify odor compounds from manure and livestock facilities, but these types of devices are not amenable to multi-contaminant detection, specifically in large area, real-time coverage applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for a unique air sensing and monitoring approach that can quickly and continuously detect and measure concentrations of a variety of gases, at a reasonable cost, and over a wide area. In response, we propose to develop Air-Sense, a high performance, reliable, wide area monitoring system that will be able to conduct simultaneous real-time multi-analyte monitoring with a minimal number of components to meet the air quality guidelines for livestock and animal operations. This will be achieved by developing a distributed optical fiber sensor cable containing multiple sensor fibers for ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide in one cable embodiment. Each sensor fiber will consist of a core fiber coated with a colorimetric sensor indicator immobilized in a highly permeable polymer optical cladding. As the sensor fiber is exposed to the target gas, the cladding color will change, and hence affect the light attenuation accordingly. An optical readout module with integrated software and signal processing algorithms will send an alarm when hazardous gas emissions are elevated above 10 percent of Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) levels, and ventilation is required. The sensor cable will allow for multiple sensor detection, thereby adding redundancy to the monitoring process.",Reuben Sandler,Chief Executive Officer,(424) 263-6305,randdoffice@intopsys.com,Manal Beshay,Lead Chemist,(424) 263-6360,mbeshay@intopsys.com,,,,"['livestock facility', 'hydrogen sulfide', 'carbon dioxide', 'nose', 'redundancy', 'real-time', 'management', 'polymer', 'mass spectrometric gas chromatography system', 'base gas chromatography mass spectrometric detection', 'rate', 'limit', 'light', 'cancer', 'measurement', 'optical readout module', 'cladding color change', 'response', 'performance', 'person', 'gas compound', 'ventilation', 'air sensing', 'multiple', 'accuracy', 'real-time coverage application', 'gas emission', 'false alarm rate', 'exposure', 'type device', 'livestock', 'monitoring process', 'real-time gas sensor analysis', 'emission', 'core fiber coat', 'detect', 'short term symptom', 'treatment', 'detection', 'heart disease', 'short term effect', 'cost', 'level', 'Trace Gas Analyzer Volatile', 'short term exposure', 'gas', 'monitoring', 'state-of-the-art sensor system limit', 'monitoring approach', 'livestock environment', 'air ventilation', 'air quality', 'animal operation', 'multi-contaminant detection', 'contaminate environment', 'attenuation', 'health effect', 'respiratory disease', 'lead chronic disease', 'long term', 'software signal processing', 'optical fiber sensor cable', 'long period time', 'optical cladding']"

According to the American Cancer Society         new cases and        deaths are expected in       Despite advances in therapy  the   year survival rate is less than     Current treatments of PC include surgery  radiation therapy  chemotherapy  and immunotherapy but they all only slightly prolong survival or relieve symptoms in patients with PC  The limitations in efficacy of available treatments highlight the need for new treatments  Pancreatic inflammation is known to increase the risk of PC  High macrophage infiltration into the tumor mass correlates with the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis development  As found recently  triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells  TREM     an inflammation amplifier  plays a role in PC progression  Expression of TREM   on myeloid cells  including tumor  associated macrophages  TAMs   in patients with PC is upregulated and correlates to disease severity  We hypothesize that TREM   inhibition can improve survival of PC patients  Current approaches to TREM   suggest to block binding of ligand to TREM    The true nature of the TREM   ligand is not yet known  highly increasing the risk of failure of these approaches in clinical development  The long term objective of the proposed project is to develop a novel  ligand independent approach to a TREM   targeted treatment of PC  The major goal of the Phase I study is to demonstrate that specific inactivation of TREM   with novel inhibitory peptides suppresses PC tumor progression in animal model system and improves survival  Phase I specific aims are to     generate and characterize injectable formulations of TREM   inhibitory peptides with different half lives  and    test the TREM   inhibitory peptide formulations in a mouse model of PC  The peptides will be designed using SignaBlokandapos s proprietary model of TREM   signaling  These non  toxic peptides employ novel  ligand independent mechanisms of action and are anticipated to have less severe side effects  In order to increase peptide solubility  bioavailability and targeting to TAMs  we will utilize SignaBlokandapos s proprietary nanosystem for macrophage targeted delivery of water insoluble and poorly water soluble drugs  We will use a BxPC   xenograft mouse model of PC to test the ability of the peptides in free and particulate forms to inhibit cancer progression and promote survival  It is anticipated that the proposed research will identify novel anticancer lead compounds that will set the stage for the development of new targeted therapies of PC  thereby leading to a higher survival rate of the patients  If successful  the Phase I will be followed in te Phase II by toxicology  absorption  disposition  metabolism  excretion  ADME   pharmacology and chemistry  manufacturing  control  CMC  studies  filing an Investigational New Drug  IND  application with the US Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and subsequent evaluation in humans  Importantly  TREM   may play a role in the progression of not only PC but also other tumors  Thus  successful completion of Phase I will provide the proof of concept of the hypothesis that might be applicable to a variety of tumors         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related death in the United States  and the   year survival rate is less than     Current treatments are

A key element to surgical implementation of this low-risk, cost effective technique is electrical mapping of phrenic nerve motor points using laparoscopic instruments. With the emergence of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgical (NOTES) techniques, as an enabling technology, the success of the laparoscopic diaphragm stimulation could provide access to a larger population of SCI and ALS patients. This proposal focuses on advancing the state of the art of instruments to implement neurostimulation mapping techniques with a translumenal approach. Overall the proposed research is intended to advance ventilatory care for patients with respiratory insufficiency. The long-term goal of this technology is to: 1) develop translumenal mapping instrumentation and techniques, 2) develop electrode delivery techniques to minimize the surgical risks, 3) demonstrate the use of NOTES neurostimulation in ventilatory assist patients, and 4) support the development of further NOTES neurostimulation. The specific aims of this Phase 1 effort include the development of translumenal mapping instrumentation to: 1) accurately and repeatable stimulate the inferior surface of the diaphragm, 2) sense the transient pressure response to the applied stimulation to obtain a quantifiable measure of optimal stimulation sites, and 3) accurately place temporary marking on the diaphragm surface to facilitate insertion of percutaneous intramuscular electrodes at the optimal locations. According to the 2005 National SCI Database 21.2% (2,503) of all individuals with tetraplegia and 7.1% (748) of all individuals with paraplegia required a mechanical ventilator for pulmonary support during their initial rehabilitation admission. Inherent complications to mechanical ventilation are infection, tracheal injury and equipment malfunction. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a common occurrence among patients with prolonged use of an artificial ventilator; pneumonia is the most common cause of death after spinal cord injury. Likewise, 84% of deaths in ALS are related to respiratory failure. Most ALS patients choose death rather than mechanical ventilation. Development of NOTES diaphragm stimulation will provide clinicians with tools to reduce risks associated with the positive pressure mechanical ventilation and costs. Further complications of mechanical ventilation which may be addressed by this technology include diaphragm atrophy, barotrauma, posterior lobe atelectasis, and impaired hemodynamics which are normally improved by maintaining a more natural negative chest pressure. Successful realization of this technology has a significant value proposition for the patients and healthcare providers and therefore substantial commercial potential. This project proposes the development of a novel diagnostic endoscopic neurostimulation device using Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) techniques. The first intended application of the device is to reduce the risks and costs associated with implementation of a diaphragm pacing stimulation system.",ANTHONY IGNAGNI,,(440) 774-2488,aignagni@synapsebiomedical.com,ANTHONY IGNAGNI,,(440) 774-2488,aignagni@synapsebiomedical.com,,,,"['artificial ventilator', 'applicant', 'neurostimulation', 'respiratory failure', 'equipment malfunction', 'individual', 'emergence', 'diaphragm atrophy', 'positive pressure', 'Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery', 'mechanical ventilation', 'technology', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'surface', 'development', 'pneumonia', 'inferior surface diaphragm', 'element', 'success laparoscopic diaphragm stimulation', 'stimulation site', 'diaphragm stimulation', 'project', 'electrical mapping', 'low-risk', 'patient', 'National SCI Database', 'healthcare provider', 'sense transient pressure response', 'neurostimulation mapping technique', 'surgical risk', 'cost', 'implementation', 'stimulation', 'SCI', 'pacing stimulation system', 'research', 'translumenal mapping', 'location', 'spinal cord injury', 'mechanical ventilation infection', 'mechanical ventilator pulmonary', 'endoscopic neurostimulation device', 'electrode delivery technique', 'application device', 'posterior lobe atelectasis', 'translumenal mapping instrumentation technique', 'implant laparoscopically']"

Plasma from AB individuals, often referred to as universal plasma, is in high demand for both military and civilian emergency transfusions as it does not contain anti-A and anti-B antibodies that could induce fatal hemolytic reactions as a result of their binding to the recipient's red blood cells. Supplies are often insufficient to meet demand however as only 4% of the overall donor population is type AB. Therefore, there is a large potential market for a simple cost-effective product that can quickly remove anti-A and anti-B blood group antibodies (BGA) from single donor or pooled plasma units to generate a sufficient inventory of universal plasma and potentially alleviate the need to store type-specific plasma altogether. An expanded supply of universal plasma will simplify storage and distribution logistics for civilian and military blood banks allowing them to meet widespread demand without straining donor resources. During Phase II studies, CytoSorbents developed a novel device called HemoDefend-BGA Adsorber that removes >99% of anti-A and anti-B antibodies from plasma, while maintaining coagulation activity. Moreover, the HemoDefend-BGA device works just as well on fresh whole blood (FWB), sparing beneficial substances such as coagulation factors, RBCs and platelets to alleviate the reliance on low titer O whole blood (LTOWB) donors for emergency FWB transfusions. While substantial cost savings in the procurement, documentation, testing and the simpler storage and distribution logistics of universal blood products will significantly offset the cost of this technology, cost constraints within the blood banking community dictate that costs are a major consideration to adoption of new technologies. Therefore, this proposal will focus on optimizing manufacturing methods to achieve a cost-effective product for high volume production. The refined device will be validated for BGA reduction with minimal effect on coagulation and hemostatic activities in bench top studies with plasma and whole blood. The HemoDefend-BGA adsorber is a potentially paradigm-shifting technology that can be utilized during plasma collection and processing to generate an inventory of single donor or pooled universal plasma units potentially alleviating the need to store type-specific plasma altogether. In addition, its use at the time of blood collection would provide not only the option of LTOWB and low titer plasma but low titer RBCs and platelets as well, minimizing the unpredictable risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions from the residual plasma in all blood components, increasing the safety of the blood supply.",Leanne Diefenbach,,(732) 398-5407,LDiefenbach@cytosorbents.com,Maryann Gruda,,(732) 398-5404,mgruda@cytosorbents.com,,,,"['storage', 'type-specific', 'testing', 'logistic universal blood product', 'time blood collection', 'product', 'titer o blood ( ltowb ) donor', 'resource', 'individual', 'anti-a', 'plasma blood component', 'hemostatic activity bench', 'safety blood supply', 'market', 'beneficial substance coagulation factor', 'plasma collection', 'anti-b blood group antibody', 'constraint blood banking', 'cost technology', 'technology', 'volume production', 'HemoDefend-BGA device work fresh blood ( fwb', 'plasma blood', 'emergency transfusion', 'anti-b antibody', 'coagulation activity', 'shock', 'unpredictable', 'anti-a anti-b antibody', 'donor population type ab', 'documentation', 'manufacturing method', 'cost', 'strain donor', 'distribution', 'cost-effective', 'plasma unit', 'saving procurement', 'phase', 'device', 'inventory', 'coagulation', 'emergency surgery']"

With the potential to transform the transportation and services markets, vehicle classes of interest include single-aisle, thin/short haul, and urban air mobility. These vehicle concepts rely on hybrid electric systems to provide propulsive power through the use of a turbo-generator combined with electrical energy storage. For turbo-generators/range-extenders utilized in regional EAP concepts, small lightweight turboshaft engines are an excellent choice due to their maturity and availability. However, at small power scales, gas turbines are less efficient. This can be addressed using a recuperator to inject waste heat from the turbine back into the thermodynamic cycle upstream of the combustor.nbsp;Micro Cooling Concepts (MC2) has developed technologies for fabricating extremely compact metallic heat exchangers with high heat transfer while reducing size and weight by 2-3X, using the printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHX) approach.nbsp;Using additive manufacturing to create heat exchangers with finer scale and higher aspect ratio features can magnify the advantages of MC2rsquo;s existing technology, resulting in recuperators with minimal weight, volume, and pressure losses.nbsp;Analysis shows that the 3D-printed hybrid laminate recuperators provide reductions in volumes and weight of 4.4X and 7.7X, respectively, compared to conventional recuperators.nbsp;These weight reductions translate directly into shorter fuel payback times and opportunities to increase payload or range.

Complications resulting from CKD are common, and the disease is an enormous financial burden for the US health care system. Despite substantial efforts of investigators around the country, a pharmaceutical treatment to directly reverse the process of fibrosis (a key physiological process in CKD) and regenerate nephrons has remained elusive. The demand for novel therapeutics is only expected to grow. Animal models are the gold standard for basic and applied kidney disease research, but there are no widely used noninvasive imaging tools for assessing renal fibrosis within these models; this represents a major limitation in the kidney disease research and drug development fields. The work proposed herein will result in a platform that will dramatically accelerate the pace of basic and applied research in CKD. SonoVol is proposing to build and validate a novel renal fibrosis imaging platform and validate it against both in vivo and ex vivo gold standards. The prototype system will be deployed within SonoVol’s VegaTM platform, a robotically controlled volumetric scanning device for high-throughput rodent imaging. This will remove existing bottlenecks and ensure accurate and repeatable renal fibrosis measures. This work will proceed via three stages: First, we will develop hardware to allow accurate and repeatable sampling of ultrasound elastography images by adding a rotational degree of freedom, enabling long and short axis measurements regardless of how a kidney is positioned. Second, we will develop software to facilitate automated kidney localization and acquisition of multiple ultrasound stiffness mapping modes to allow fibrosis to be evaluated whether or not a kidney contains fluid filled cysts. Finally, we will validate the platform using in vitro phantoms and then two different in vivo models for renal fibrosis. The data will be compared to gold standards for both in vivo and ex vivo readouts.Project Narrative Approximately 37M people in the USA are affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it is the 9th leading cause of death in the USA.

Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data.

Allegro Diagnostics is developing a portfolio of lung cancer biomarker products that are based on the principle that inhaled substances, cigarette smoke in particular, cause a  field of injury  throughout the lungs and airways, and that the global gene expression measured in easily accessible large airway epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy reflects biologic events occurring in the distal lung, where cancer develops. The first of these products, and the focus of this SBIR proposal, is BronchoGen, an 80 probe-set biomarker of lung cancer in current or former smokers. The immediate goals of the SBIR proposal are to evaluate the effect of new and improved reagents that have appeared in the past year on the BronchoGen test characteristics, to transfer the BronchoGen test to a commercial laboratory from the academic laboratory in which it was developed, and are to further validate the biomarker's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in a sample of 400 patients. The ultimate product of these studies will be a CLIA-approved lung cancer biomarker that will be submitted for FDA approval. Multiple sites throughout the country and two high-volume international sites will provide samples of bronchial epithelial cells from patients in whom bronchoscopy is being done to evaluate the possibility that a patient has lung cancer. Airway epithelial cell samples will be placed in a new RNA preservative that is effective when stored at room temperature for several weeks, sent by Federal Express to a commercial laboratory specializing in gene expression array studies, and CEL file results transported to Allegro Diagnostics for analysis and correlation with a computerized database that stores important clinical data, including ultimate diagnosis, the clinical process of diagnostic evaluation, staging of the cancer (if present), cell type and ultimate outcome. The initial product of these studies, BronchoGen , will reduce the costs and risks of unnecessary diagnostic procedures diagnosis, and risks of invasive procedures, and the amount of time between the suspicion of lung cancer and cancer diagnosis, by avoiding additional diagnostic procedures that often occur after non-diagnostic bronchoscopy. With BronchoGen , physicians will receive a lung cancer 'present or absent' statement, together with a statistical explanation of the biomarkers positive and negative predictive value and accuracy and sensitivity. The project goals of developing more timely and accurate diagnostics for lung cancer are directly aligned with NCI's mission to reduce the burden and eliminate adverse outcomes of cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Allegro Diagnostics is developing a  toolbox  of products focused on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the world. The focus of this SBIR, and the 1st of these products, is BronchoGen, a gene-expression based biomarker for use in patients undergoing bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of lung cancer.

There are over 272 million passenger cars registered in the United States and over one billion worldwide. As the transition to electric vehicles takes hold, potential markets for ultra-fast battery chargers for these electric vehicles will be sizeable. Estimates for the commercial market for electric vehicle charging stations is projected to reach $27.7 billion by 2027 from an estimated $2.5 billion in 2019. This project addresses the persistent problem of long electric vehicle recharging times and associated “range anxiety” among consumers. More specifically, an ultra-fast electric vehicle recharging system will be applied to emerging fast-charge batteries so that delays in re-energizing electric vehicles will be no more time-consuming than similar delays for refueling gasoline-powered vehicles. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the basic feasibility of an ultra-fast battery-charging system for consumer applications that can fully re-energize a typical light-duty electric vehicle in as little as six minutes. The project will focus on development of safe power conversion and transmission equipment that will be applied to power-matched fast-charge batteries currently emerging in commercial markets. Because the power levels required for ultra-fast EV charging are necessarily high, the project will focus on innovative measures to ensure public safety and system reliability while obtaining high electrical efficiencies. A relatively low power model will be constructed in Phase I for later scale-up. Solving technical challenges associated with an ultra-fast high-power electric vehicle charger has potential to advance knowledge of electromagnetics, power electronics, automated control, and materials science associated with ultra-fast electric vehicle recharging.

This program seeks to provide a new avenue to laboratory-quality arsenic detection and quantification in a field-portable device at reasonable cost. The long term vision for this technology is that it will become a key environmental science tool to support the development of strategies to prevent arsenic-related disease in individuals and population and to help people liver longer, healthier lives, a key aspect of the mission of NIEHS. We envision this technology also having a role in the international arsenic contamination picture, particularly in countries such as Bangladesh, where over 70% of drinking water wells contain toxic concentrations of arsenic. Specific Aims of the Phase II program will include design and construction of a prototype field-portable analytical system for detection of arsenic in drinking water at concentrations between sub-ppb and many ppm. The performance of the instrument will be characterized in the lab for the effects of real sample issues, including several classes of interferences and environmental variables. Once fully characterized, the prototype will be tested in the field with selected stakeholders in the drinking water distribution system arena. The new prototype technology will be benchmarked against standard analytical laboratory methods and other available field tests, such as colorimetric kits. During Phase I, favorable comparison to standard analytical laboratory analysis has already been obtained on drinking water samples from New Mexico and remediation treatment process water from Nevada. These results provide high confidence that the proposed analytical methodology will be an effective tool to prevent arsenic related disease from drinking water exposure. In the United States and globally, contamination of drinking water by naturally occurring arsenic puts populations at risk of a variety of arsenic-related diseases. The proposed Phase II program will provide a cost- effective and highly accurate way to monitor arsenic in drinking water at the site of the water source. The long- term vision for this technology is that it will become a useful tool for helping to arsenic-related disease among exposed populations.",STEVEN BECK,,(303) 530-0263,contracts@eltronresearch.com,MICHAEL CARTER,,(303) 530-0263,eltron@eltronresearch.com,,,,"['water', 'distribution system', 'effective', 'applicant', 'term vision technology', 'arsenic contamination', 'technology role', 'prototype field analytical instrument', 'treatment process', 'development', 'field test', 'class interference', 'test', 'drinking water', 'lab effect real sample issue', 'exposure', 'stakeholder', 'healthy life', 'colorimetric kit', 'arsenic drinking water', 'analytical methodology', 'analytical laboratory analysis', 'design', 'goal phase', 'cost', 'environmental variable', 'arsenic related disease', 'contamination', 'construction', 'arsenic-related disease', 'phase', 'prototype test field', 'long term', 'laboratory-quality', 'mission', 'program']"

D. Miller and Associates (SDMA) research team has led the field of research in Opacified Fibrous Insulation (OFI) since 2003.Early OFI prototypes equaled the thermal performance of Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) with MultiLayer Insulation (MLI) using gold-coated shields and vastly reduced cost and maintenance of TPS for hypersonic vehicles.In 2015, OFI prototypes demonstrated improved efficiency in Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) TPS, and became part of the preferred HIAD TPS.Research is proposed on specific problems hindering further improvement and commercialization of OFI, including (1) improved consistency and (2) better correlation between theory and experiment.Improvements in these two areas support development of a model that predicts performance from first principles, allowing OFI to be optimized for TPS on future Air Force and other DoD missions, as well as other aerospace and industrial applications.To meet these objectives, SDMAs researchers will team with experts in nonwoven production to demonstrate improved manufacturing concepts, and experts in radiative heat transfer to verify theoretical performance correlates with experimental data.Phase I is expected to confirm that sample consistency improves using scalable manufacturing processes, and that data from more consistent samples provide better agreement with the model based on first principles.; BENEFIT: SDMA will commercialize Opacified Fibrous Insulation (OFI) in fabricated shapes, and supporting engineering services.Initial customers will include aerospace companies that are developing hypersonic systems.Since saving a pound on the Thermal Protection System (TPS) saves a second pound in the airframe, and these savings combined save a third pound of fuel, the total savings on one vehicle studied was 453 lbs., equivalent to $4,530,000 at current launch costs of $10,000/pound.Specialized insulations will also be developed for other markets and applications.Potential transition partners include the Air Force, DARPA, NASA and the U.S. industrial sector for hypersonic application.

Although several drugs have shown promise in animal models to some extent, many human clinical trials of therapies for AD have failed. Therefore in vitro models using human-derived cell lines or patient-derived genetically-manipulated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) that overexpress the different isoforms of β-amyloid have shown interest. These hiPSCs with the acquisition of full cellular functionality, microenvironment mechanostructural cues and mimicking vascular defects observed in patients with AD are in development. Further, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity that prevents neurotoxins from entering the brain and bidirectional molecular communications between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system, are critical for AD therapeutic strategy in the laboratory models. These models with 3D perfused engineered micro-sized organ systems can help costly and risky drug testing with quantitative and mechanistic data. However, high throughput portable passive system that can connect multiple organs and provide quantitative pharmacokinetics data, is still to be realized. Therefore, Biopico Systems Inc teams with UC Irvine to propose a Humanized Organ Plate Paradigm (HOPP) for high throughput Alzheimer's disease therapeutics that can accurately and reproducibly mimic the AD phenotype in vivo and be amenable to high-content screening and assay applications. With the preliminary results from the patent-pending organ platform and measurement instrumentation, Biopico will utilize existing drugs that have failed in clinical trials and given positive indications to perform proof-of-concept of our platform. The Phase I research aims are to: (i) Develop functional blood-brain-barrier in vitro pharmacological HOPP system in high throughput format, (ii) Integrate multi-organs for morphological, functional, gene expression and metabolic markers metrics and (iii) Validate HOPP system using pharmacokinetic modeling and in vitro to in vivo extrapolation. The successful completion of these aims will provide a strong foundation for developing a commercial organ system in Phase II to customers developing therapeutic agents for AD.

The underlying mechan-isms of Type I Hot Corrosion and Type II Hot Corrosion are increasingly well-understood.  Modern turbine engine designs that seek to achieve better fuel efficiency in part by increasing turbine inlet temperatures are strong candidates for nickel-based superalloy turbine disk materials.  As disk temperatures approach 700C, designers must consider the likelihood and effects of Type II corrosion.  Type II corrosion is typically characterized by localized corrosion pitting caused by melting of sulfur-containing salts.  Type II hot corrosion pits have been shown to decrease the fatigue resistance of superalloys due to initiation of fatigue cracks at hot corrosion pits.  However, the rigorous analytical models and tools needed by turbine engine designers to predict Type II corrosion effects are not currently available.The overall objective of this research program will be to develop DARWIN-HC?a probabilistic Type II hot corrosion, fatigue cracking, and fatigue life prediction software tool for nickel-based superalloy turbine disks.

The technology in this project is based on a chatbot that sustains ongoing, interdisciplinary conversations with each student. The platform is designed to provide middle school students with curriculum materials that expose them to authentic and engaging real-world problems that, over the course of weeks or months, come together to form a cohesive response to a project prompt. The goal of this project is to build and refine this new form of eLearning platform that has the potential to greatly improve engagement and learning outcomes, especially for low-income and minority students. This goal will be achieved by making the standards-aligned educational content meaningful and relevant to the interests of students and by catering the instructional materials to each individual student's skill level so they can move through the materials at their own pace towards mastery. To measure the impact of this technology on student outcomes, this project will involve state-of-the-art efficacy research in accordance with guidelines in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This SBIR Phase I project is concerned with developing a forward-looking education platform built around a chatbot that sustains long term, goals-oriented conversations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and based on a decision tree architecture. The highly-customized chatbot is designed to make project-based learning scalable by empowering students to choose and customize their own project theme from a set of options, and then providing conversational explanations and practice questions that illustrate how Common Core standards apply to the student?s project. This research undertaking will involve developing and training custom neural networks to interpret student responses and questions. It will also involve developing algorithms that correctly identify each student's level of reading comprehension and, independently, conceptual understanding. With an understanding of the student's level, another algorithm will be developed that selects the appropriate materials and resources at the student?s reading comprehension level. These algorithms will be refined through user testing and a preliminary study of the efficacy of this education intervention will be tested in a correlational study with statistical controls.

Place,,Charlottesville,VA,22901-2496,DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Introduction  The Blink based Communication  BLINC  System will allow any patient who retains oculomotor control to reliably signal for assistance and communicate basic requests to a caregiver  It uses infrared  IR  cameras and illuminators to continuously monitor a patient in bed  and to detect blink signals even in a dark room  It is specifically designed so that all components  including the cameras and illuminators  can be placed at a significant standoff distance  making it easy to use and minimally intrusive  The system is initially targeted to help ALS patients  who commonly lose virtually all voluntary muscle control but frequently do retain oculomotor control  The BLINC System will provide access to basic and essential communication capabilities that can be extremely difficult or impossible to provide with existing technology  with an ultimate goal of improving quality of life for severely impaired patients  Problems Addressed  The BLINC System will not require any components to be placed in close proximity to the patient  or to be positioned or configured each time a patient is placed in bed or repositioned  The system addresses a significant capability gap in current high end Augmentative and Alternative Communication  AAC  devices  which effectively leverage oculomotor capabilities for communication  but require the device to be placed directly in front of the patientandapos s face and in close proximity  which is not practical in al settings  Specialized buttons and switches can provide a simple call bell  but these require a degree of muscle control and must be carefully placed in close proximity each time a patient is moved  Phase I Results  The Phase I e ort successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the approach through human participant tests involving healthy subjects  A prototype BLINC System was implemented that detected blink signals  a sequence of four blinks of approximately two seconds each  in real time and activated an audio signal  The tests showed at the     confidence level that the system accuracy exceeded the     target for Phase I  A specificity of over     also demonstrated that intentional blink signals could be reliably discriminated from normal eyelid movements including spontaneous blinks  Phase II Summary  The proposed Phase II e ort will build on the successful Phase I prototype system  expanding the set of communication capabilities  and enhancing the robustness of the system  Enhancements will ensure robustness to a wider range of user poses  user positions  and lighting conditions  Phase II human participant tests will involve ALS patients in two stages  first assessing system accuracy in a very controlled clinic setting  and second assessing usability and false alarm rates in multi day trials in patientandapos s homes  An important aspect of Phase II will be involving caregiver so that usability can be understood from both the patient and caregiver perspective  a key factor in overall system acceptance PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The Blink based Communication  BLINC  System will allow ALS patients and others with severely restricted movement and speech capabilities to reliably signal for help and to communicate basic requests while in bed and solely by blinking  and by allowing significant stand o distance for the sensors will ll an important capability gap left by existing eye tracking and blink detection systems  The proposed Phase II SBIR research e ort will     enhance the robustness of the prototype BLINC System  ensuring reliable operation across a broader range of user positions and poses      simplify the procedures for installing and calibrating the system      demonstrate its ecacy through human participant tests with ALS patients  and     pave the way for FDA approval and subsequent commercial product sales,CONNIE HOOVER,,(434) 973-1215,barron@bainet.com,ALEC BATEMAN,,(434)

Since their introduction in 1985, suture anchors have been widely used in a variety of surgical procedures. They provide a significant savings in time and cost to both surgeon and patient. However, there are a number of shortcomings with current anchors. Existing suture anchors perform poorly in osteoporotic bone and cannot be repositioned easily following implantation. The issue of attachment to osteoporotic bone will become increasingly important with a growing active adult population.   We propose the development of a novel, new suture anchor technology that possesses the same benefits of existing devices but yields significant advantages. The new anchor is less invasive, can be readily repositioned, provides exceptional performance in poor quality bone, and can be used as a revision device for other anchors.   Based on the Phase I confirmation of feasibility, the goal of the Phase II work is the specific product development of the rotator cuff repair anchor, followed by design modification for a diverse product line of anchor products. Rotator cuff repair is a high volume surgical operation that often involves poor quality bone in the proximal humerus where standard anchor devices do not provide adequate fixation strength. The development of this anchor and associated insertion tooling will utilize a finite element analysis design tool. A thorough bench testing regimen will be performed to establish regulatory equivalence to a commercial predicate device, with a special focus on fixation strength in an osteoporotic bone model. A group of shoulder specialists will assess the utility of the anchor system by performing simulated cuff repairs in a cadaveric model. Rotator cuff reconstructions using the prototype systems and current devices will also be tested in a dynamic shoulder testing system to evaluate the cyclic failure risk of early rehabilitation protocols. Many references in the literature that indicate that early, aggressive rehabilitation regimens may cause a significant decrease in anchor fixation strength, laxity in the cuff reconstruction, and even the elevated failure rate of the operation. A review panel of surgeons in a diverse range of specialties will contribute specifications in the development process and critically review the system design and final project results.",ALAN GRESZLER,,(216) 937-2800,AGRESZLER@BIOMEC.COM,JAMES PRICE,,(216) 937-2800,JPRICE@BIOMEC.COM,,,,"['rehabilitation protocol', 'saving time', 'reference literature', 'group shoulder', 'osteoporotic bone model', 'applicant', 'device test', 'product', 'rate operation', 'cyclic failure', 'quality bone', 'product line anchor product', 'development', 'base phase', 'specification', 'failure', 'rotator cuff reconstruction', 'project', 'prototype system current', 'patient', 'soft tissue bone', 'anchor device', 'finite element analysis design tool', 'anchor system', 'design', 'quality', 'secure', 'goal phase', 'revision device anchor', 'laxity cuff reconstruction', 'active adult', 'bench testing', 'implantation', 'bone proximal humerus', 'review panel surgeon', 'device', 'osteoporotic bone', 'rotator cuff repair high volume', 'surgical operation', 'dynamic shoulder testing system']"

To address these technical challenges, we propose to develop PUMA, a computational framework that enables a perception-aware UUV behavior in which a vehicle can autonomously take a course of actions that would improve its awareness of surroundings, so that the assigned mission can be effectively carried out. PUMA effectually employs machine learning to enable such intelligent behaviors. More specifically, PUMA incorporates two machine learning enabled components (LECs), namely, the Perception LEC and the Controller LEC. The Perception LEC will be pre-trained to detect a target object in a side-scan sonar image, and outputs the property of the detected object. The Controller LEC then takes that object property along with the measured vehicle/world state information, and outputs the desired vehicle velocity and direction based on the learned control law.

The goal of this project is to fabricate an innovative MEMS-based hybrid supercapacitor with energy density > 100 µWh/cm2 (one of the greatest values reported for micro-supercapacitors), high potential density (at least 2x greater than most efficient LIBs at different current rates), and excellent cycling life (over 10,000 cycles; 6.7X greater than LIBs) through a cost-effective process. Through the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I program, we will investigate the feasibility of fabricating all-solid-state zinc-ion hybrid MEMS supercapacitor microdevices as high-performance energy storage devices, for energy harvesting applications that solve the conventional limitation of low gravimetric and areal energy densities, and poor lifetime. To this end, we will first perform a study to select a cost-effective technique for mass production of MEMS supercapacitors, relying on the maximization of the material index (energy density × power density × cycling life /cost per unit cm2). Our preliminary results confirmed that a highly porous supercapacitor-type carbon nanofiber (CNF) cathode and Zn nanosheets-electrodeposited carbon-based anode in the presence of solid-electrolyte ZnCl2 in a single package as zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor has the potential to fabricate one of the most efficient MEMS devices. Interestingly, electrodes can be mass-produced through already-matured fabricating processes and the proposed solid electrolyte can be deposited by a simple spray coating, implying ease scale up in the next phases. Inspired by the preliminary results from aqueous ZnCl2 electrolyte, the PVA-ZnCl2 will be initiated for the first time as an electrolyte to address the tradeoff between cycling life and energy density. Reducing the interfacial resistance in the presence of solid electrolyte will realize the fabrication of an efficient micro-sized energy storage as the outcome of this project.

This project will use a high purity, pulsed inductive, gas-breakdown plasma source to generate a plasma with a high directed velocity.  The source is positioned a large distance from the accelerator, resulting in separation of neutral gas from the accelerator and collimation of the ions entering the accelerator.   The goal of Phase I and II is to develop and field an ion source on the first stage of an accelerator.  Phase I developed a configuration for an inductively driven gas-breakdown plasma source that produced a >10 ms pulse of Argon plasma of >100mA/cm2 ion current density, with strongly axially directed ion energy of about 80 eV, and sub-eV transverse temperature.  The plasma was highly reproducible in spatial, temporal, and energy distributions.  Phase II will explore techniques to control the temporal shape of the ion pulse and improve the spatial uniformity.  More detailed measurements of the source, both at the gas breakdown region and downstream, will be performed to enhance the understanding of source behavior.  A 100 keV acceleration stage will be developed and used with the ion source to precisely quantify source performance, especially the transverse and longitudinal ion temperatures, and to explore effects of changes in source characteristics on beam quality.

The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 20. Although this disease is treatable if diagnosed early by colonoscopy, most people with colon cancer have no symptoms, initially. Once a cancer has spread beyond the primary site of origin, the five-year survival rate is only slightly better now than it was 30 years ago and 90% of tumors metastasize. Tumors are genetically unstable and heterogeneous and can become drug resistant. To improve treatment for colorectal cancer and cancer in general, new therapeutic targets must be identified and representative animal models are needed to develop and test new concepts of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.

As the plants age, safe operation becomes increasingly important and more frequent monitoring of the health of plant equipment becomes vital. This was recognized by the leaders in the industry over twenty years ago when studies of equipment aging and development of ways to handle aging began. Today, electrical cable aging and its impact on plant safety and operation is a worldwide concern for nuclear power plants. Loss of a cable because of a cable fault or problem can impact the operation and function of important plant safety equipment and/or the loss of performance and operational data. Knowing the aging condition of critical plant wiring and in particular aging that could result in degraded performance of a cable circuit is extremely important to the availability and safe operation of the plant. Current techniques provide problem identification and fault location capability but further advancements in the available techniques and development of new ones are needed before they can be relied upon for effective and consistent cable aging assessment. During the proposed project, AMS will investigate the state-of-the-art in cable aging evaluation techniques applicable to nuclear power plant wiring systems, and investigate their effectiveness for identifying aging mechanisms in cable circuits through objective laboratory experiments. Measurements will be correlated against classical tests to build a database of aging relationships that will simplify analysis. The result of the Phase II project will be a holistic cable aging assessment program that will provide comprehensive cable testing capabilities, analysis tools, training and technical services, and turn-key plant implementation for assessing the aging of plant wiring systems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Successful commercialization of this product will result in an easily implemented, operational cable aging assessment and management system using the state-of-the-art in cable condition monitoring techniques that will provide correlated aging evaluations of plant cable and wiring. Applications will include tests to evaluate cable problems, insulation aging, and gross or localized cable and connector problems as well as an assessment of the aging condition of the cable.

Narrow well defined Raman peaks and lack of sample preparation requirement make Raman scattering well suitedfor in-situ analysis of composites and solid rocket propellants.   Raman spectroscopic analysis can be made via small (200 mm core), inert, silica/silica clad optical fibers.  One fiber is used for sample excitation via laser diode, and another fibercollects the Raman scattered light and carries the signal to a remote, portable spectrograph.   A semiconductor laser diode offers long life, can be very compact, and can operate at near-IR wavelengths where sample fluorescence is minimized while takingadvantage of the very sensitive and full-spectrum capabilities of silicon CCD array Raman spectrum detection.

New therapeutics based upon novel chemical scaffolds are vital to the biodefense armory because they are likely to be effective against both natural and engineered resistant forms of B. anthracis. Our strategy is to build effective anthrax therapeutics not by targeting the viability of the organism but by targeting the mechanism of pathogenesis directly. Toward this aim, we have identified drug-like small molecule LF inhibitors through a combination of screening of chemical libraries and 3D sub-structure database mining. These inhibitors have been shown to specifically bind to LF with low (M potencies in enzymatic assays and to protect macrophages against challenge with toxin containing LF. The identified inhibitor classes are novel and devoid of non-drug like features such as the hydroxamic acid and peptidic backbone, which are common in many known protease inhibitors. Thus, this validated hit series forms the basis for development of efficacious, safe and orally bioavailable drugs against anthrax. To further enhance the probability of success of this project, the X-ray structure of the inhibitor bound in the active site of LF has been solved thus providing a powerful tool, which we will use to guide the inhibitor refinement process through structure-based drug design. The overall goal of this project is to develop a small molecule LF inhibitor to treat anthrax. In Phase I, we will apply proven techniques of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry; inhibitor-enzyme complex X-ray crystallography and structure-based drug design (SBDD) to rapidly synthesize and evaluate derivatives of this new validated hit series. In an iterative process, we will probe focused compound libraries for features contributing to tighter binding and more potent inhibition of LF by measuring the enzymatic, cellular activity and specificity of derivatives. We will determine the X-ray structures of improved inhibitors bound to the LF active site, and use these data to develop refined pharmacophore models to guide further probing of the structure activity relationship (SAR). In addition, we will assess compounds for optimal ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination) properties (e.g., liver microsome stability, Cyp isoform inhibition and Caco2 permeability). Compounds with sufficient enzymatic, cellular potency and ADME properties will be synthesized at the 1-2 g level and tested for efficacy in a LF induced rat death model. Successful rescue of rats from LF-induced death will qualify compounds as in vivo-validated leads. In Phase II, we will further evaluate these leads for in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity and safety pharmacology, in two species, in order to develop them into pre-IND clinical candidates, suitable for human clinical trials (Phase III).", ,,(508) 757-2800,,NORTON PEET,,() -,,,,,"['effective', 'mining', 'use datum', 'active site', 'applicant', 'x-ray structure', 'tight binding', 'caco2 permeability', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'pharmacophore model', 'inhibitor-enzyme complex x-ray crystallography', 'pharmacokinetic property', 'small molecule lf inhibitor', 'lf', 'cellular potency', 'development', 'non-drug', 'safety', 'bind', 'metabolism', 'security', 'low', 'refinement process', 'compound vivo-validated lead', 'x-ray structure inhibitor', 'probability', 'cellular activity specificity', 'property', 'LF', 'relationship', 'absorption', 'level test', 'liver', 'iterative process', 'lf-induced', 'distribution', 'structure activity', 'goal project', 'bio-terrorist', 'clinical', 'phase', 'structure-based drug design']"

Combustion of abundant domestic coal provides low cost power, but it releases over 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.  New technology is needed to reduce these CO2 emissions while maintaining this secure energy source which is so essential to the domestic economy.  Long-term geologic sequestration of CO2 in deep western U.S. coalbeds could eliminate 10 to 40 percent of U.S. thermal electric coal emissions.  In this project, the integrity, capacity, and cost of this process for CO2 disposal will be quantitatively evaluated.   Phase I will evaluate 4 major western U.S. coal regions, from North Dakota to Utah, for specific CO2 disposal characterization.  Quantified CO2 disposal capacity and cost will be determined by definition and analysis of secure, long-term storage cells in deep coal units with low mining potential.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Cost effective high volume CO2 disposal technology will be avidly sought by thermal fossil fuel industries as the emission of CO2 becomes more costly.

One current technology uses electrochemical electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, which can be stored and re-converted into electricity later. However, this process requires ultra-pure water, which is unavailable in many areas in the world, especially in islands and coastal regions. Thus, there is an increasing demand for direct use of seawater in electrolysis processes. The major challenges of using seawater in an electrolyzer are corrosion, chlorine competition, and expensive materials. To solve these problems and improve lifecycle cost effectiveness of the discussed process, TDA proposes a low-cost direct seawater electrolyzer system that can utilize real seawater for electrolysis to supply both electricity and potable water to the military and civilians. In Phase I we will build a proof of concept system and test it using simulated seawater sources. Catalysts and membranes will be designed and tested to meet the performance requirement with a seawater feed. We will then fabricate membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) and test them in a lab-scale electrolyzer at TDA. Cell performance and durability will be evaluated and compared to literature in Phase I. We will then perform system size and efficiency calculations and estimate the electricity and water production rate of our system.

Strengthening of damage zones to mitigate catastrophic failure is accomplished in the new composite through dynamic redistribution of structural substance.  This process relies on functional (piezoelectric and solid electrolyte) constituents which are introduced, in the primary system configuration, as a hybrid fiber coating.  The self-healing phenomenon involves electrolytic transport of structural substance within solid electrolyte towards the damage zone where its deposition yields strengthening effects. This process is guided by piezo-induced potential gradient, which reflects on local stress rise in the vicinity of damage zone.  The piezoelectric effect converts the mechanical energy concentrated in damage zone into the electrical energy needed to drive the self-healing process.  In short, the self-healing phenomenon makes constructive use of the otherwise destructive strain energy concentrated in damage zone for mitigation of catastrophic damage growth.  The Phase I research validated: (i) the viability of electrolytic mass transport in solid electrolytes to render strengthening effects; (ii) the ability of piezo-induced potential and charge to guide and drive electrolytic transport of mass in solid electrolytes; and (iii) the potential to integrate the piezoelectric and solid electrolyte constituents rendering self-healing effects in the context of a hybrid coating system.  The following objectives will be accomplished in the proposed Phase II project: (i) development and thorough characterization of nano-structured piezoelectric and solid electrolyte fiber coatings which complement distinctly high functional qualities (greatly benefiting the rate and extent of self-healing) with desirable thermo-mechanical attributes; (ii) development of theoretical models for integrated design of composites for both self-healing and thermo-mechanical performance requirements; (iii) design, processing and thorough characterization of self-healing composite materials; (iv) design, manufacturing and experimental evaluation (of the self-healing attributes and airworthiness) of selected helicopter components (tail cone and elevator); and (v) development of selection criteria for self-healing composites based on application-specific cost/benefit analyses.

Quantitative molecular diagnostic methods are critically dependent on the ability to stabilize the collected sampleprior to purification and  analysis. While conventional methods for invasive blood draw procedures exist, there is a desire and movement in both developed and un-developed countries for less invasive procedures for sample collection and transport. For example, while the use of less invasive procedures such as a finger heal stick are desirable, the ability to collect, stabilize, transport and process the samle is not optimized. These current procedures have well known issues with the stability of these samples (that require temperature controlled shipping or transport) as well as workflows that promote possible sample cross contamination. To solve this challenge, we have proposed a set of studies to determine the feasibility of an alternative approach that would maintain the streamlined collection procedure (as with DBS samples), but allows for significantly increased sample stabilization. The system also streamlines the workflow in the laboratory by eliminating the need to directly contact the sample with tools to excise them from the collection material, alternatively using water to re-suspend the stabilized sample. The proposed system, if determined feasible over a range of analyte concentrations, may represent a dramatic step forward in the ability to diagnose patients that are HIV positive with improved analytical sensitivity.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sample stabilization remains a critical component to the ability to accurately detect and quantitative detect HIV from whole blood and plasma sources. The current proposal is aimed at the reduction of the expense and labor intensive manner in which samples are collected, transported, stored and processed in diagnostic laboratories. The ability to collect samples into a solid form factor that is stablein uncontrolled environmental conditions for long periods of time will enable more robust purification and detection of HIV RNA and pro-viral DNA. The system which significantly minimizes user steps may reduce the risk of sample cross contamination over methods commonly used such as dried blood spots as the stabilized samples are only required to be solvated with water prior to purification.",JASON APPLETON,,(843) 714-5760,Jay@acxend.com,JASON WEST,,(843) 714-5760,Jay@acxend.com,Stub,,,"['contact sample tool', 'sampleprior purification', 'solvate water', 'applicant', 'purification', 'sample stabilization', 'temperature', 'environmental condition', 'analysis', 'sample cross contamination', 'analytical sensitivity', 'user step', 'risk sample', 'patient', 'detect', 'store process', 'detection', 'streamlined collection procedure', 'Sample stabilization', 'cross contamination method', 'dry blood spot', 'critical component ability', 'issue stability', 'quantitative molecular diagnostic method', 'system', 'biomedical research', 'transport process samle', 'sample']"

Experiments conducted so far did not produce the needed three dimensional profiles to model phenomena such as turbulence anisotropy and inhomogeneity, variations of inner-scale and outer-scale of turbulence, and strong departures from Gaussian statistics.   During the first phase of this SBIR project, Optical Physics Company (OPC) demonstrated the feasibility of its approach for 3D turbulence measurement through analysis, simulation and laboratory demonstration.  A laboratory experiment optically scaled to match a 28 km range from airplane to ground was assembled.  Ability to obtain high resolution turbulence profiles in three dimensions in air-to-ground and air-to-air scenarios has been verified. The overall maturity of the technology now stands at TRL 4.    During Phase II a complete 3D turbulence profiling system will be demonstrated outdoors across a 100-500 m horizontal path using an eye-safe 1.55 micron laser.

Effectively utilizing this hardware is challenging and requires many new programmer skills. Despite these complications with programming them, this hardware provides dramatic performance benefits, and is already used in three of the ten fastest supercomputers in the world, so this trend is unlikely to slow down in the near future. Despite this move to hybrid architectures and the diversity of hardware options available, programmer effort for common tasks is often reduced via the use of software libraries. Examples of commonly used libraries are FFT, BLAS, and LAPACK. The programmer expects that optimized and functionally correct versions of these and other routines are available for any given hardware. Ideally, the use of libraries reduces debugging time, eases porting to alternative or future hardware, and gives excellent performance because it is tuned by experts in the hardware and the algorithms. In reality, the space is fragmented, which pushes significant burden to the software developer.  For this project, EM Photonics is developing an open source, unified set of fundamental libraries for use on hybrid HPC systems. EM Photonics will provide baseline functionality for common library routines written in OpenCL that will be cross-platform and open source. We will also provide a framework that will allow others (researchers, hardware vendors, commercial library providers, etc.) to plug in alternate implementations. In Phase I, we prototyped a BLAS library, showed LAPACK functionality, and created a highly-performing matrix-multiplication routine using a robust automatic tuning system. We devised a system by which highly compatible kernels can be written without burdening the programmer and then automatically tuned to achieve both code clarity and the highest performance. In Phase II, we will expand the supported routines to include a commonly-used subset of LAPACK, sparse BLAS, and FFT. We will also build out a framework for easier development and performance optimization of generic kernels, as well as facilities for adding device-specific code.

Each e-book will focus on a specific topic and include three original related sub-topic stories. Each story will be accompanied by: 3 interactive learning games (9 in total) that foster developmentally appropriate critical thinking skills with scientific applications; study questions accessible on each screen that provoke further thought and investigation, and recommended experiments to do at home or in the classroom. The topic area chosen for the Phase I e-book is Weather, and the stories will focus on Wind, Temperature, and Rain/Clouds/Rainbows. These e-books will contain options to view the story content in ASL (video), as well as English text and audio. All science terminology will be viewable individually as a sign video clip. All instructions within the e-books will include ASL video translations with voice-over. A Dictionary, accessible through any of the screens, will enable users to read, play ASL video of, and print graphics of the signs and concepts related to all of the scientific vocabulary used in the e-book. The broader impact of the ASL-translated STEM e-book series is increased knowledge and reading achievement scores of deaf children through the use of these assistive materials. Reading achievement scores of deaf children usually fall far short of those of hearing children with comparable abilities because English is a second language for deaf children (ASL being their primary language). While many deaf students may not understand a sentence in print, they may understand it perfectly if it is presented in ASL. Incorporation of ASL into science content positively impacts on reading achievement and information retention. A major reason deaf people frequently have limited knowledge of science and are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is that much formal scientific information is not in accessible formats. In fact, nearly all scientific information currently available is audio and text-based and without interpretation into sign language. By starting with young children, we can stimulate early interest in STEM fields.

However, research suggests that the majority of physicians do not follow established practice guidelines or use evidence-based practices when assessing or treating their ADHD patients. A community intervention model has been developed by the Duke University Medical Center ADHD Program which promotes the implementation of evidence-based practice procedures among community pediatricians. Research results from this program suggest that a program such as this can be very effective at improving pediatricians' practice behaviors and child outcomes. However, the model's use as it is currently implemented is limited in scope because of its paper-based methods. In-person training, paper-and-pencil rating forms, faxed reports, phone-call reminders, etc. inhibit the geographic generalization of this model and increase treatment delivery costs. This application supports the development of an innovative Internet-based software program that provides evidence-based ADHD assessment and treatment methodology to community physicians. Its features provide physician education about ADHD assessment and treatment; web-based rating scales for parents and teachers; web-based access to rating scales results for physicians; and remote consultation with ADHD specialists. During Phase I, a prototype was developed, tested out in a small field trial, and feedback was obtained from the various end-users. In Phase II, we plan to 1) complete programming and software development of the full product; 2) accomplish a widespread, geographically-diverse rollout of the full product; 3) predict adoption of the software among community pediatricians; and 4) establish marketing of the final product.

Current best practice is to pull an oversized mandrel through a split sleeve in the hole to induce beneficial residual compressive stresses and this improves fatigue life significantly. However, the benefit is reduced for chamfered rivet holes, where the compressive stresses are lower. The goal of this project is to use cavitation peening to enhance the cold expansion process by inducing deep, high magnitude residual compressive stresses around the hole and in the chamfered area, thereby improving fatigue life. The cavitation peening process currently uses a high pressure jet to sweep over the surface of the part while it is submerged in a water tank. This project will modify the technology so the part does not have to be submerged in a water tank so large structures can be cavitation peened. The cavitation peening equipment would be mounted on a roll around cart and the peening nozzle clamped to the surface to be peened.

We propose authoring a scene renderer using proven Computer Graphics Imagery (CGI) techniques to produce target maps that WaveTrain will use to represent an array of sources.  The code library will be compiled in such a way that is will be accessible by other engineering software like MatLab.  We will outline specific scene generation processes we&quot;ve used in the past and how they can be incorporated or expanded upon to produce higher fidelity dynamic scenes in WaveTrain, with less effort.  We will also provide a road map for expanded thermal modeling in WaveTrain that include the scene renderer and three dimensional (3D) targets as part of the solution.   Sources associated with state changes like smoke will also be addressed with a novel solution involving hyper-voxels and fractals.  Finally, we propose investigating a commercial render engine to augment the scene renderer.  Mr. Joseph Riley with be the principal investigator for MZA and Dr. Joseph Haus will be the lead for UD.  BENEFIT:  Adding this expanded synthetic scene generation capability to WaveTrain will provide higher fidelity passive and active wave optics imagery and support dynamic changes in the target.  The effect of this will be better evaluations of optical tracking concepts and controls in turbulent and cluttered environments, resulting in a reduced need for expensive field experiments.  The time needed for an analysis to simulate engagements will also shrink since many separate and slow running scripts will be optimized and collated into a single library linked to WaveTrain components.

Many of the standard practices employed by fabricators have, in some way, been derived from both experience and tribal knowledge, with little consideration for the underlying physics. While this has been sufficient for the manufacture of prototype hardware, there exists a need for a better understanding of how carbon-carbon behaves during processing as manufacturing shops transition to higher rate, production-focused facilities. In a production environment, process optimization is critical to reducing fabrication times and minimizing scrap rates; this type of optimization can be achieved through execution of physics-based models of the manufacturing process. In the effort proposed herein, Materials Research & Design will work with Carbon-Carbon Advanced Technologies (C-CAT) and Allcomp to develop, demonstrate, and validate a processing model designed to predict the physical and mechanical properties of structural carbon-carbon materials and components. Specifically, this model will take the form of a custom user element (UEL) capable of interfacing with the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) finite element code, Abaqus. The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of using a UEL to predict the temperature and rate-dependent response of C/Ph as it converts to C/C. The UEL accuracy was verified by comparing its predictions to the legacy Process Environment Model (PEM). The Phase II effort will use additional measured in-process data supplied by Southern Research to continue development of the physics-based UEL which aims to predict residual stress, shape change, and material properties of complex carbon-carbon geometries.

Current therapies are limited by the small number of approved drugs, toxicities, drug- drug interactions, mode of administration, and growing problems of drug resistance and emerging pathogens. Treatment also suffers from a lack of rapid clinical diagnoses, leading to dependence on broad-spectrum antifungal drugs. Moreover, existing antifungal drug classes target membrane and cell wall integrity, and there is a need to develop drugs against targets with new modes of action. Available evidence suggest Ess1 might be one such target. Ess1 is an essential prolyl isomerase that is highly conserved in fungal pathogens, including Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and its mechanism-of-action is complementary in that it does not overlap with targets of existing antifungals. Several small molecule andquot;hitsandquot; that show chemical-genetic interactions with Ess1 mutant cells have been identified, and fungal Ess1 structure differs sufficiently from its human ortholog (Pin1) to suggest that development of selective Ess1 inhibitors is feasible. The specific aims of this Phase I proposal are to (1) validate Ess1 as a druggable target and (2) identify inhibitor scaffolds that are chemically tractable for a andquot;hit to leadandquot; drug development program. The approach will use biochemical and whole-cell assays to test inhibitors against Ess1 and Pin1 enzymes, fungal pathogens, and mammalian cells, and to develop a robust exploratory chemistry program to accomplish these aims. The outcomes will advance this program into hit-to-lead, lead optimization and pre-clinical studies (Phase II). The long-term objective is to develop Ess1 inhibitors into a new class of broad-spectrum antifungal drugs.Project Narrative In January 2020, the NIH Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases gathered leading investigators from around the world to discuss the emergence of a multi-drug resistant pathogen called Candida auris and the global problem of systemic fungal infections. The conference highlighted the critical need to develop new, broad-spectrum antifungal drugs to combat not only Candida auris but other Candida and Aspergillus because of increasing resistance to azole drugs, and growing echinocandin resistance in C. glabrata. This proposal aims to develop small molecule chemical inhibitors against Ess1, a new essential fungal target with a unique mode of action, and to develop these into a new class of broad-spectrum antifungal drug to tackle the problem of emerging and drug-resistant fungal infections.",KEITH BOSTIAN,,(908) 737-7207,kbostian@katherabio.com,STEPHEN PARENT,,(908) 202-5699,sparent@katherabio.com,,,,"['life-threatening', 'hit-to-lead', 'clinical diagnosis', 'emergence', 'structure', 'long-term', 'whole-cell assay test', 'antifungal', 'development', 'exploratory chemistry program', 'project', 'resistance', 'echinocandin resistance', 'grow problem drug resistance', 'mode action', 'outcome advance program', 'treatment', 'drug development program', 'evidence', 'mechanism-of-action complementary overlap', 'mode administration', 'broad-spectrum antifungal drug', 'multi-drug resistant', 'phase', 'NIH Institutes Allergy Infectious Diseases', 'integrity', 'phase proposal']"

Primary among these are increased specific impulse and reduced launch weight. Previously, the use of gaseous O2/H2 was limited by the lack of a combustion chamber material capable of withstanding the temperatures of stoichiometric O2/H2 combustion. Ultramet recently solved this problem by demonstrating a material system capable of operating for several hours under stoichiometric conditions utilizing only radiation cooling. Because the chambers reached temperatures of nearly 2600?C during testing, a water-cooled injector was used. That will not be an option in space, so an injector must be developed that will be able to withstand these extreme temperatures and minimize thermal soakback to the valves. In Phase I, an uncooled combustion chamber/injector system for use with stoichiometric O2/H2 propellants was designed, fabricated, and hot-fire tested. Phase II will focus on improving the life of the combustion chamber by taking a critical look at the designs of both the chamber and the injector.

Such dense interconnects are realized by the generation of hundreds of thousands of microvias in the substrate layers on which the electronic modules are built.

Past interventions to improve adherence have had mixed results, with the most success stemming from those that were very complex and costly. Convenient, cost effective tools to increase clinician/researcher awareness of adherence while creating minimal patient burden are needed. Self-monitoring (SM) is increasingly used across diverse medical fields as both a clinical tool and research method to gather critical adherence data from patients. SM presents myriad advantages over traditional data collection methods including lower recall bias, increased generalizability, and lower patient burden. However, traditional paper-and-pencil methods of SM are too complex and labor intensive for patients to complete easily, resulting in poor compliance and inaccurate, low quality data. In order to best sample patients&#039; behaviors and experiences in real time and in natural environments, computerized SM technologies (C-SM) for mobile devices hold tremendous promise, with patients reporting them to be more convenient, less time consuming, easier to use, and more motivating to complete. Yet, despite the vast potential offered by C- SM, broad scale dissemination and use in medical treatment and research has not yet shown viability due to prohibitively high demands for time, finances, and trained technical staff to develop individualized software. Furthermore, currently available C-SM technologies are highly specialized for a specific purpose with little ability to adapt technology used for C-SM with one patient group to another. The goal of this Phase I project is to develop andtest a technology infrastructure to support creation and broad scale deployment of C-SM for mobile devices. The proposed Mobile Application System for Health Monitoring (MAS-HM) would allow clinicians and medical researchers to: (a) create C-SM assessments, protocols, and prompts specifically for deployment to mobile devices (smartphone app, mobile web, or SMS text messaging), (b) monitor and track patients&#039; SM progress, and (c) conduct synchronous data analysis to determine patient adherence level. Most importantly, the MAS-HM will utilize a ubiquitous technology platform that would remove key barriers to adopting C-SM methods and make mobile deployment of C-SM accessible for any medical intervention or research study. This Phase I proposal will accomplishthree specific aims: 1) Design the MAS-HM prototype; 2) Conduct feasibility groups with clinicians, medical researchers, and adolescents and young adults with chronic illness; and 3) Establish final prototype specifications using data compiled and analyzed from the feasibility groups. These specifications will be used to guide Phase II development prior to efficacy testing. The final MAS-HM product will leverage the ubiquity of mobile devices combined with their powerful networking and computational capabilities to significantly increase C-SM accuracy, timeliness, and ease of use. Greater access to and use of C-SM should translate into improved patient adherence and treatment effectiveness.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical non-adherence has been identified as a major public health problem that imposes a considerable financial burden upon modern health care systems [1-5]. Because of the complexities in measuring adherence, no estimate can be generalized, but poor adherence is to be expected in 30-50% of all patients, irrespective of disease, prognosis, or setting [2, 3, 6-8]. This burden has been estimated to cost  100 billion each year in the US [4], including 10% of hospital admissions [2, 3]. Adherence is also critical to the integrity of clinical research findings in order to preserve sufficient statistical power for analysis and to minimize the potential for obscured findings. Indeed, as clinician&#039;s increasingly rely on treatment protocols that are based on clinical trial evidence, it is critical toaddress adherence in the realm of research as well [9-14]. The proposed MAS-HM would remove barriers to adherence monitoring and provide significant advantages in convenience, cost effectiveness, and utility over existing clinical tools and research instruments.",JANEY MCMILLEN,,(919) 677-0102,derosier@3cisd.com,JANEY MCMILLEN,,(919) 677-0102,mcmillen@3cisd.com,,,,"['medical treatment', 'Mobile application system', 'testing', 'clinical tool', 'paper-and-pencil method', 'cost effectiveness', 'applicant', 'computational', 'self-monitoring', 'awareness', 'financial', 'low recall bias', 'software', 'mobile web', 'technology', 'Health Monitoring', 'sms text messaging', 'technology platform', 'research viability', 'datum collection', 'disease', 'synchronous datum analysis', 'feasibility group', 'development', 'realm research', 'c-sm', 'chronic illness', 'specification', 'accuracy', 'real time', 'medical field', 'patient complete', 'low', 'patient report', 'mobile deployment', 'assessment', 'effectiveness', 'modern health care system', 'estimate', 'statistical power analysis', 'patient', 'protocol', 'treatment', 'design', 'quality', 'deployment mobile device', 'knowledge', 'time consuming', 'cost', 'goal phase', 'c-sm method', 'public', 'health problem', 'potential', 'technical staff', 'integrity', 'monitoring', 'patient group', 'phase proposal accomplishthree', 'evidence', 'natural environment', 'mobile device', 'treatment protocol', 'phase', 'demand time', 'behavior', 'health', 'patient outcome']"

Most expeditionary and fixed bases have motion detection, visible and infrared video sensors, and sensor zones for intrusion detection. Threats can be complicated events operating in multiple domains. While the proliferation of security sensors provides raw data, human operators must generally assess the sensor observables and quickly decide if a threat is detected. Operators are overloaded by the volume of data feeds and may not recognize the threat or fail to recognize it in a timely manner. Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to automate the detection and characterization of threats, provide a threat assessment, and reduce the workload on force protection video surveillance operators. The benefits realized with such automation include faster, more accurate threat detection, improved courses of action, and reduced cost.

The detector bottleneck encountered is in two areas: one is detector count rate limitation, and the other is its limited rejection rate of background in order to examine very dilute systems. By the development of the multilayer analyzer array detector (MAAD), we effectively increased the count rate, and therefore the efficiency of fluorescence detection. Now, we are proposing to largely increase the rejection rate by developing muitilayer analyzer pair array detectors (MAPAD). Our Phase I project has shown that such a detector can be made with a high rejection rate and a reasonable throughput. With two-stage rejection of primary and secondary multilayers, the rejection rate will exceed 200 times with a 15 to 20% throughput. With 28 double multilayer pairs, the detector will collect close to 2% total solid angle at 6 KeV. The anticipated gain on the effective photon counts will be as high as 40 times on very dilute systems. The detector can be made tunable in a large energy region, and easy to operate. With a flexible design, the detector can perform the pair rejection as well as the single multilayer rejection, just like a MAAD. Thus the detector can cover a large sample dilution range from a few mM down to 20 microM or a few ppm. For trace metal detection, the approachable concentration can go even lower. This kind of sensitivity should enable us to approach new systems, such as the examination of biological relevant metals in vivo as well as very dilute systems in environmental, material, physical and chemical research. The detector has a very good market potential benefiting efficient use of high flux beamlines. By expanding the XAS technique to new systems, the detector can potentially enter into new markets.",KE ZHANG,,(215) 386-1912,KZHANG@AOL.COM,KE ZHANG,,(630) 230-0012,HDTECH60561@YAHOO.COM,,,,"['dilute system', 'detector count rate', 'fluorescence detection', 'applicant', 'sample dilution', 'BioSync Report development', 'examination', 'market', 'sensitivity', 'detector system', 'development', 'count rate', 'throughput', 'energy region', 'metal', 'design', 'detection', 'phase project detector', 'potential', 'environmental', 'rejection rate', 'system', 'detector cover', 'efficiency', 'biological']"

Acousticsystems designed to find bottom mines must not only detect objects with very small target strength against a reverberant background, they must provide extremely high resolution in order to discriminate between mines and mine-likeobjects on the bottom.Even with high-resolution sonars, observation of an objectfrom multiple look angles is sometimes needed to successfully classify as non-mine or mine.  Classification therefore limits the search rate of such sonars, both because high operating frequenciesare needed to obtain high resolution in angle and because achieving multiple look angles slows the rate of advance.    This proposal will investigate use of multistatics to improve mine detection and extend ranges at which classification is possible.Practical system configurations for a multistatic acoustic mine detection sonar will be developed and estimates of detection range, localization accuracy and classification range will be developed for these configurations.   Search rate will be determinedas a measure of effectiveness for comparison with conventional monostatic MCM sonars.The acoustic sensor developments anticipated under the proposed project willimprove the detection of small objects on the sea floor.   Further, by providingimprovedresolution with lower frequency sonars, these developments are anticipatedto improve the range at which such objects can be classified.  The primary candidate markets for this effort are anticipated to be the US Navy's mine avoidance and MCM programs.However, resolving objects multistatically can support improved classification in tactical ASW sonars as well.

Smoking cessation support delivered by health care professionals can be a highly effective means of reaching out proactively to smokers and helping them quit. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to advise and influence smokers regarding nicotine related therapy and to counsel smokers. Yet, pharmacists experience significant barriers to providing consistent, high-quality supports to smokers, including; time limitations, lack of training in effective counseling techniques and lack of reimbursement for counseling smokers (Ossip-Klein et al., 2000). This software system will provide basic training in pharmacy based smoking cessation counseling, save pharmacist time by conducting relevant assessments and provide high quality feedback to the smoker. The goal of this Phase II application is to finalize development and test the efficacy of the computer-based expert system (""Exper_Quit"") developed in our Phase I project. Specifically, our goals are: 1) to increase the frequency with which pharmacists address smoking cessation in their interaction with customers, and 2) to increase the number of smokers who will be successful when making a quit attempt. The first six months of the project will be devoted to finalizing programming, coding, testing and writing content for the additional assessment and feedback components. Efficacy of the system will be tested at a HMO-based pharmacy. Exit interview data will be collected from smokers to assess the extent of pharmacist counseling for smoking with no intervention (observation only: OBS). Pharmacists will then be trained in providing smoking cessation counseling. Two additional groups of smokers will recruited by pharmacists and randomly assigned to either the TEST or CONTROL conditions. TEST participants will complete assessments, receive personalized feedback and a matching pharmacist report and be counseled by the pharmacist. These subjects will return in 1 month for a follow-up Exper_Quit assessment and to receive feedback on their progress. CONTROL participants will complete the baseline assessment but will not receive feedback and no pharmacist report will be printed. Exit interviews will document the extent of pharmacist counseling.

ThermoAnalytics is proposing to create a modeling tool that will allow an analyst to rapidly assess the performance of a cooling system based on the evaluation of multiple approaches and parametric studies for a vehicle in different environments and load scenarios. Our approach is to adopt a component model paradigm that uses pre-built models of cooling system components as building blocks for system analyses.

The material properties of AlN permit power devices to operate at these extremes, promoting device shrinkage for automotive applications as well faster switching and more efficient power conversion. Several challenges have heretofore prevented widespread adoption  of  AlN,  most  significantly  the  inability  to  reliably  achieve  high  n-  and  p-type conductivity, which is fundamentally important for the performance of semiconductor devices. The overall objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of ion implantation to incorporate donor and acceptor species within AlN that would yield technically useful n- and p- carrier concentrations. We will develop processes for the high temperature implantation of these dopant atoms in high quality AlN homoepitaxial thin films grown on AlN substrates. During Phase I, Si+ and Cd+ will be implanted into low dislocation density and low impurity AlN. Implantation profiles will be compared to modeled results of various ions, energies and temperatures. High temperature post-implantation processes will be developed to recover implantation-induced damage and to activate implanted dopants. Contacts to n-type AlN will also be demonstrated and optimized. Achieving  the  stated  objective  will  enable  the  manufacture  of  better  power  switches  and therefore more efficient electricity conversion. With an ever increasing share of our electricity passing through power conversion devices, the success of this program will directly support the Improved Energy Efficiency mission of DOE and can potentially impact every electrical power consumer in the world. New materials are required for a more efficient electrical power devices, such as those used in automobilies, industrial motors, and for electricity conversion between the home the utility grid.

Walpole,MA,02032,This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project is aimed at building the first prototype of an automated ballast water exchange (BWE) monitoring and reporting system. The system will use acoustic modems that use ultrasonic acoustic energy through metal structures as the means of communication. Wireless networking based on radio frequencies (RF) is not very effective within enclosed metal structures such as the hulls of ships. The acoustic modems can be used to overcome such limitations and can establish a local wireless network for data transfer among sensors located in various parts of the vessels. The through-the-hull communications technology is at a nascent but proven state. Existing modems transfer data at 20 bits per second. The Phase-I research showed that a data rate of 500 bits per second (or higher) would exceed the data throughput requirement for BWE monitoring.  Ballast water management is a global issue. The foreign micro-organisms not only destroy the bio-diversity in the native coastal eco systems but create problems for regional economies as well. The impact from the introduction of  Zebra mussels in great lakes is estimated at over four billion dollars. Therefore developing an effective and inexpensive technology for monitoring the ballast water has a broader impact on the society.

In the proposed concept a set of visible and IR sensors track CSOs and provides a prioritized location map for an active laser tracking unit, which is then used to interrogate CSO and extract information for their discrimination and detection of threat cloud (threat/ non-threat). Multi-mode/modality images and data of CSO can be presented at various signal levels to simulate a typical engagement timeline. Active detection technology enables system to operate in both day and night and for “dark pass” tracking of satellites through the Earth’s shadow, adding means for optical signal gating, which can greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in an acquired data. During Phase I we will design and integrate the proof of concept testbed to demonstrate TDI feasibility on targets that imitate CSO. During Phase II, we will extend the performance capabilities of the proposed system, design and build a breadboard for verifying and optimizing the predicted system performance, demonstrate and refine laboratory operation, and estimate the working envelope.   BENEFIT:  An important benefit of the proposed concept is to leverage the capability of existing and advanced sensors by integrating the data produced by all of them to improve significantly the image information content beyond that produced by any one of them. The most immediate application is to surveillance systems that employ multiple sensors. The technologies developed under this effort can be applied to various air and space surveillance systems against fast moving, closely-spaced airplanes, missiles and space objects.

Terfenol-D is superior to ordinary PZT because it has larger maximum strains and higher energy density, and is not subject to fatigue or depoling.  For these reasons, composite Terfenol-D should be superior to both composite PZT and ordinary Terfenol-D.  This is especially true at high frequencies, since the brittleness of ordinary Terfenol-D makes laminating it expensive and does not allow very thin laminations.  SatCon proposes to investigate the hydrostatic magnetostrictie properities of an improved composite Terfenol-D recently developed by Prof. G. Carman's group at UCLA.  It is the hydrostatic properties that are relevant for underwater sonar transducers with dimensions that are small compared to a wavelength, as would be true of a small transducer used in an array.

These devices are widely used in the data storage and communications industries.  Commercial photonic devices are typically made of rigid materials including inorganic oxides and semiconductors, however, these materials are costly, expensive to deposit and process, and have poor mechanical properties (e.g., brittle, delicate).  Given these disadvantages, there is increasing interest in developing polymeric photonic devices that are more robust, flexible, easier to process and integrate into 2D and 3D circuits, and less expensive than devices made of inorganic materials.  The most heavily used techniques for manufacturing polymeric photonic devices are conventional top-down photolithographic processes and dry ion etching.  These processes are expensive and increase optical scattering losses due to roughening of the polymeric material during etching.

The proposed detector will be specifically designed for x-ray microanalysis to provide orders of magnitude advancement in the performance over conventional energy dispersive systems. During the Phase 1 effort of this project, we successfully designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a ~2cm2 silicon drift detector (SDD) array. All of the goals of Phase 1 were met, and most were significantly exceeded. Accomplishments included development of a closely spaced array of four 0.5 cm2 SDD elements. Energy resolution of 143 eV FWHM at 5.9 keV was achieved on the best device. All four devices produced energy resolution below 200 eV FWHM. Importantly, these results were obtained at relatively short peaking times and additionally the detectors do not require cryogenic cooling to obtain this performance.   In Phase 2, we will develop a prototype x-ray spectrometer for insertion into an electron microscope. The prototype will include the finalized detector array of up to four elements based upon the Phase 1 study. Each element will be capable of attaining electronic noise of <10 e- rms at peaking times on the order of 100 ns, allowing throughput rates exceeding 106 cps each.

Extended outdoor testing of the baseline SunRing will also occur providing additional experience with the overall azimuth drive design approach. Phase 1 will be followed by commercialization steps in Phase 2 where the SunRing heliostat is transitioned from a Technology Readiness Level of 5 to 7. This is accomplished with 1-year of outdoor performance testing by a USA National Laboratory. Additionally, lifetime performance testing will occur on the SunRing’s drives.

Minimally invasive surgical techniques deliver specific intervention without the morbidity associated with large open incisions. Image-guidance technology has the potential to provide significant benefits for minimally invasive surgery, where surgeons must usually cope with difficult access and reduced visualization. A new generation of minimally invasive surgery has emerged that uses a robot to hold surgical tools during laparoscopy or thoracoscopy, under direct control by the surgeon. Surgical robots offer an excellent platform upon which to fuse the benefits of image-guided and minimally invasive surgery. The da Vinci surgical robot system has a high-fidelity video display, a stereo endoscope, and sensors to track the position of each surgical instrument and the endoscope, offering a potentially ready-made stream of data for registration and tracking.   The proposed project will bring together a leading academic center of excellence in image-guided therapy and the market leader in surgical robotics to give da Vinci the fundamentally new capability of steering to a specific point in the patient's frame of reference. Using the current da Vinci control paradigm, the robot simply follows the surgeon's relative motions and has no concept of the patient's frame of reference. With the new ability to navigate through the patient's frame of reference as described by preoperative imagery data sets registered to the patient during surgery, da Vinci will enable surgeons to more accurately perform targeted tasks such as biopsy, tumor ablation, resection planning, and gene therapy in a minimally invasive manner. The proposed project uses liver surgery as a motivating application. Phase I will address three feasibility milestones: Establishing communication between the surgical robot and existing image-guidance software, establishing robot tracking error under 2 mm, and establishing surface registration errors under 5 mm.

Currently, effective fertilizer management is often limited by the lack of accurate soil nutrient data, which in turn is limited by the time and cost of soil sampling and analysis.  In particular, nitrogen is one of the most critical nutrients for a large number of crops, but the difficulty in accurately and quickly measuring local soil nitrate-nitrogen has hampered the efficient management of nitrogen based fertilizers.  A robust, economical, and fast soil nitrate measurement system thus has the potential to significantly increase agricultural nitrogen use efficiency.  The objective of this proposal is the development of a rapid nitrate soil sensor utilizing the optical detection of nitrate-nitrogen in soil.   The feasibility of directly measuring soil nitrate-nitrogen (without reagents) in soil-extractant mixtures will be determined, and appropriate methods for removing interferences from the soil background will be developed.  This feasibility study will form the initial step in developing a field-deployable soil nitrate analysis system. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in allowing growers to rapidly and economically measure soil nitrate-nitrogen levels, thus enabling them to improve their fertilizer management decisions.   For example, split application of nitrogen (through sidedressing) is known to greatly improve nitrogen use efficiency.   However, sidedressing is very time sensitive, and management decisions of how much nitrogen to apply are often limited by the cost and slow turnaround of current soil testing procedures. Additionally, it is anticipated that the development of a rapid soil nitrate measurement tool will facilitate the improvement of current fertilizer prescriptions by providing researchers with a valuable tool for field studies.  The development of a rapid soil nitrate measurement tool thus offers the opportunity to greatly increase fertilizer use efficiency.  Fertilizer is a significant agricultural cost (over $18 B was spent in the U.S. on fertilizer in 2007) and the inefficient use of fertilizer has large additional societal and environmental costs: nitrous oxide arising from nitrogen-based fertilizer use causes between 4%-9% of the driving force for global warming, and nitrogen runoff from agriculture causes serious water quality issues, both locally and nationally.  Thus improving fertilizer management will have large economic and environmental benefits.",Michael Preiner,MS,(650) 387-7729,preiner@solumtech.com,Michael Preiner,MS,(650) 387-7729,preiner@solumtech.com,,,,"['local soil', 'management', 'nitrogen runoff agriculture', 'nitrogen critical nutrient', 'field-deployable soil', 'field study', 'nitrogen-based fertilizer', 'interference', 'nitrate-nitrogen', 'nitrogen use efficiency', 'nitrate analysis system', 'development', 'nitrate-nitrogen soil', 'project', 'proposal development', 'rapid', 'nitrate measurement system', 'nitrate measurement', 'fast soil', 'decision', 'sampling analysis', 'nitrous oxide', 'nitrate-nitrogen level', 'water quality', 'cost', 'phase project', 'nitrogen base fertilizer', 'split application', 'potential', 'time sensitive', 'soil', 'method', 'nitrogen', 'nitrate-nitrogen ( reagent ) soil-extractant mixture determine', 'efficiency', 'global warming', 'optical detection']"

The signal processing algorithms evaluated during the Phase I study accurately isolate and quantify the power used by individual appliances from the aggregate power signal of the many appliances present on a leg or circuit. In the proposed project, additional enhancements will be made to the load disaggregation algorithm that will significantly improve system accuracy and reliability. Ratepayers will access a secure webpage to view their cost to operate specific appliances in their building or groups of buildings. The granular perspective provided will enable end-users to (1) calculate their own investment return periods for equipment repairs and upgrades, (2) develop data driven best practices for energy conservation, and (3) ensure that cost reductions are maintained over the long term. The broader impact will occur when the technology is deployed throughout the residential and commercial segments as part of a new generation of smart meters.

As a result, unintended drug interactions with ion channels are also of critical importance, requiring the screening of all drug candidates against specific ion channels. Unfortunately, assaying ion channels for pharmaceutical discovery and safety screening is problematic to perform in high throughput because the ion channels must be incorporated into a cell membrane to allow measurement of their ionic transport to determine their functionality. As a result, there are currently no high quality, high throughput assays for ion channel screening. Recentdevelopments of automated patch clamp instrumentation are still over an order of magnitude lower throughput than conventional drug screening for soluble proteins and also require expensive instrumentation, specialized cell lines, and consumables. For existing methods of ion channel screening, there is a large gap in information quality, throughput, and cost. Librede&#039;s goal is to develop new technologies that increase the efficiency of early stage pharmaceutical research and development. To this end, Librede is developing an alternative cell-free technology for ion channel screening using artificial cell membranes. Librede&#039;s patent pending formulation of cell-free artificial membranes can enable higher throughput and lower consumable costs while requiring less expensive equipment and trained personnel. Librede was founded by UCLA researchers and the inventors of this technology. In Phase I, we measured a 48 membrane array plate simultaneously with a multichannel amplifier and verified that the measurement performance was equal to or exceeded competitive automated patch clamp instruments. In the Phase II work proposed here, we will build on this work by integrating our Phase I instrumentation with fluid handling and motion control hardware to construct an automated workstation for cell-free ion channel screening using Librede&#039;s artificial membrane technology. We will consult with a pharmaceutical screening industry automation expert in the design, construction, and operation of our workstation and confirm that it can process and measure Librede&#039;s artificial membrane plates similarly to our previous work. To demonstrate its capabilities, we will perform a limited screen of CLIC1, an ion channel implicated in Alzheimer&#039;s disease. CLIC1 is particularly difficult toscreen with conventional patch clamp, which makes this an ideal proof-of-concept application of our platform. We will work with the Schmidt group at UCLA, who have previously demonstrated the measurement of CLIC1 in artificial membranes. We will run the workstation in full automation mode, measuring ion channel activity as a function of drug concentration for a 72 compound ion channel-targeted drug library. This demonstration is essentially identical to an industry screen and is a major milestone for Librede&#039;s development of our artificial membrane technology, which promises an order of magnitude improvement in cost and throughput for ion channel screening.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Librede is developing a novel cell-free ion channel screening platform that has the potential to significantly reduce costs and increase throughput of drug discovery and safety screening for ion channels. We will develop an ion channel measurement workstation that is capable of completely automated processing and measurement of Librede&#039;s ion channel plates after the addition of drug compounds modulating the channel activity. We are validating this workstation by screening compounds for activity against the CLIC1 human ion channel which is thought to play an important role in Alzheimer&#039;s disease.",JASON POULOS,,(858) 349-6779,poulos@librede.com,JASON POULOS,,(858) 349-6779,poulos@librede.com,Stub,,,"['automated patch clamp', 'applicant', 'personnel', 'gap information quality', 'automation', 'specialized cell line', 'high throughput assay ion channel', 'assay ion channel', 'measurement', 'technology', 'equipment train', 'measure ion channel activity function', 'human ion channel', 'pharmaceutical research development', 'performance', 'expert design', 'development', 'safety', 'drug interaction ion channel', 'processing measurement', 'automated patch clamp instrument', 'ion channel', 'pharmaceutical screening industry', 'ion channel measurement', 'cell-free ion channel screening platform', 'throughput', 'cardiac cycle', 'librede&#039;s ion channel plate addition', 'neural activity', 'quality', 'channel-targeted drug library', 'cost', 'method ion channel screening', 'physiological process', 'compound activity', 'industry', 'construction', 'capability', 'channel activity', 'instrumentation', 'cell-free technology ion channel', 'phase', 'cell-free artificial membrane', 'motion control hardware construct automate workstation cell-free ion channel', 'instrumentation fluid', 'efficiency', 'operation workstation']"

(DBM) achieved Phase 1 SBIR milestones and seeks to continue a mature program that has progressed to the hit-to-lead drug validation, prioritization and progression stage. DBM s major over-archinggoal for this program is to identify novel clinical candidate CFTR Corrector Ligands (CFCLs) for the treatment of CF through the completion of a focused Drug Discovery program and accompanying Critical Progression Path, which utilize disease-relevant humancell systems. These compounds have the potential to be disease-modifying with dramatic effects on disease progression as well as CF patients  well-being and quality of life. DBM, academic collaborators, and industry consultants (with gt70 years experiencein Drug Discovery) have refined secondary validation and tertiary prioritization assays and their order in a Critical Path such that the small molecules that are most potent and  druggable  are systematically identified and progressed forward towards selection of the best compound(s) for progression to Preclinical Development. Phase 2 aims will focus on identifying and  progressing  the best lead CFCLs from different chemical scaffolds. This CF Drug Discovery program is part of a larger initiative on CF and other chronic respiratory diseases that represent DBM s most mature drug discovery umbrella to date (see Commercialization Plan). For this revised Phase 2 SBIR-driven program application, DBM proposes three key milestones, which follow a Drug Discovery Critical Path of validation, optimization and, ultimately, the selection of inhaled clinical candidate compounds primarily (with an eye on secondary examination of the oral route of administration): Milestone 1 - Hit to Lead Validation, which will profile emerging hit-to-lead CF corrector ligands in comparison to a potent benchmark lead compound identified in Phase 1, DBM 99H7. Milestone 2 - Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Development and Lead Optimization, which will profile further and optimize the lead CF corrector compounds. Milestone 3 - Further Profiling of Lead Compounds and Selection of Clinical Candidate(s), which will identify the best compounds for Preclinical Development and Clinical Trials. Specific aims, listed under each key milestone, script key experimental tasks within the Drug Discovery Critical Path; these are defined in more detail elsewhere in Goals and Milestones and Research Strategy sections. They represent key parameters and features of compounds that will assist with the identification of the best CFCLs. Mechanistically, the most desired drug is one that both  corrects  the folding defect in delF508-CFTR within the endoplasmic reticulum as well as  activates or opens  the delF508-CFTR Cl- channel in the secretory pathway and atthe apical plasma membrane. Added benefits may include the correction of other dysregulated epithelial cell functions, such as inhibition of hyperactive epithelial sodium channels (the ENaCs) as well as the opening or up- regulation of other Cl- channels that might amplify mutant CFTR function in the apical cell membrane. DBM believes that its benchmark lead CFCL drug, DBM 99H7, is an example of a delF508-CFTR corrector, a delF508- CFTR opener, and an ENaC inhibitor. Through the study of initial lead and lead classes of CFCLs found in this CF human airway cell-driven drug discovery program during Phase1 of the SBIR grant, we have learned much about the features of lead drugs that are most desired and how to best profile and progress them. DBM is confident that this Phase 2 program will yield a primary CFCL clinical candidate as well as back-up lead CFCLs to progress forward into a therapeutic development spinout company and, ultimately, to out-license with a BioPharma. DBM, Inc.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cystic fibrosis is a progressive and debilitating lung disease that afflicts children and young adults; it causes significant morbidity and premature mortality with an average life-span of 32 years. Loss of salt and fluid secretion together with accelerated salt absorption dehydrates the airways and causes sticky mucus to accumulate. This accumulation eventually obstructs airflow, which leads to pulmonary decline in CF patients, and provides an ideal environment for infectious bacteria to colonize and cause recurrent disease exacerbations. DiscoveryBioMed, Inc., our team of academic partners from two national CF Research Centers, and industry consultant professionals derived from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca seek to garner continued funding to validate, prioritize and select the best CFTR corrector/opener ligands as new and effective CF drugs. Our program is discovering and &#039;progressing&#039; compounds in CF human lung cell systems that restore normal function of multiple CF cell dysfunctions to attenuate and, ultimately, prevent the development of CF lung disease by attacking its root causes at the cellular and molecular level of the CF airways epithelium and the airway microenvironment. These compounds have the potential to be disease- modifying with dramatic effects on disease progression as well as CF patients&#039; well-being and quality of life.

Influenza is a worldwide public health problem that infects approximately 20% of the U.S. population annually and is associated with an annual economic burden of over $11 billion USD. Although currently available influenza vaccines and antivirals are practical approaches to prevent and treat influenza, the efficacy of all available products is suboptimal and they are contraindicated for many patients. To meet the need for new approaches to prevent and manage influenza, SiVEC Biotechnologies developed a novel biological antiviral. Our core-enabling technology is a versatile nucleic acid delivery platform that is characterized as non-immunogenic, non-pathogenic bacteria. For use as an influenza antiviral (SiVEC-IAV) the bacteria are programmed to constitutively express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules, and target their delivery directly to mucosal epithelial cells, where the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway degrades viral transcripts that are necessary for influenza infection. Phase I studies demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and commercial potential of SiVEC-IAV. Phase II studies will advance SiVEC-IAV through IND-directed and preclinical studies, including optimization of the SiVEC-IAV delivery vehicle (Aim 1); definition of the SiVEC-IAV formulation and preliminary product specifications (Aim 2); and evaluation of SiVEC-IAV in a ferret model of human influenza (Aim 3). The long-term goal is to obtain FDA approval of SiVEC-IAV and make its widespread use possible. We expect that SiVEC-IAV, in combination with annual vaccination and other preventative and treatment measures, will be part of a multimodal approach to reduce the incidence of influenza as well as the cost burden. This unique approach to safely delivering nucleic acids to the appropriate cells and tissues to facilitate a therapeutic effect overcomes multiple barriers associated with the translation of RNAi-based therapeutics into clinical practice. In addition, the SiVEC delivery platform can be tailored to deliver other nucleic acids and gene editing systems to clinically relevant tissues to extend its utility outside the realm of RNAi-based therapeutics.",LYNDSEY LINKE,,(970) 310-7967,llinke@sivecbiotech.com,LYNDSEY LINKE,,(970) 310-7967,llinke@sivecbiotech.com,,,,"['tissue', 'product', 'multiple barrier', 'sivec-iav delivery vehicle', 'long-term', 'technology', 'cell tissue', 'therapeutic effect', 'development', 'gene editing system', 'safety', 'optimization', 'antiviral practical approach', 'non-pathogenic bacteria', 'sivec-iav ferret model', 'rnai-based therapeutic', 'patient', 'non-immunogenic', 'target delivery', 'phase study', 'goal project', 'public health', 'core-enabling', 'phase', 'multimodal approach', 'biological']"

The focus of this proposal is directed specifically towards the development of a regenerative power system capable of supporting the functions of the CAAP testbed. Experience derived from the design of the CMP facility has demonstrated that advanced life support system must be designed to leverage off of available power sources and thus are intimately coupled with power generation facilities and energy reuse techniques.

During Phase I a reduced finite rate chemical reaction mechanism for MMH/IRFNA and DMAZ/IRFNA combustion will be conceived.  In addition, the heuristic collision model currently in place for hypergolic gelled and ungelled combustion will be replaced with a group interaction stochastic approach.  The properties of carbon-loaded MonoMethyl Hydrazine (MMH) fuel gel and Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid (IRFNA) oxidizer gel associated with the Future Missile Technology Integration (FMTI) program will be used to compare the predictions of the conceptual model to experimental results.  A second validation effort will be completed using liquid DiMethylAminoethylaZide (DMAZ) and liquid IRFNA data.  Prediction of ignition delay time for both propellant combinations using Phase I validation will include existing Army test data. During the Option program detailed design of a test chamber capable of characterizing the spray formation and interfacial tensions associated with gelled and ungelled propellant combinations of interest to the Army will be prepared.

WAY,,Durham,NC,27712-2982,ABSTRACT The objective of this STTR proposal is to reformulate a promising PEG aptamer rapid onset anticoagulant  ROA  by applying a novel  PEG like  POEGMA polymer brush technology capable of eliminating anti PEG antigenicity  The importance of this proposal is highlighted by the early termination of a recent Phase III clinical trial of the original PEG aptamer conjugate in which severe allergic reactions occurred in individuals with high levels of pre existing anti PEG antibodies  As evidenced by this halted clinical trial  the effect of circulating anti PEG antibodies is a growing concern due to the prevalence of anti PEG found in individuals who are naive to PEGylated therapeutics it has been suggested that the free PEGs present in commonly used consumer products are a likely source of these interfering anti PEG antibodies  Our  PEG like  POEGMA polymer brush technology has been shown to confer the same PD PK advantages of traditional PEG conjugates  while simultaneously eliminating anti PEG antigenicity  We have shown that POEGMA  which breaks up the long sequences of repeating ethylene glycol units found in PEG and presents much shorter oligo ethylene glycol  sequences  does not interact with anti PEG antibodies  We expect that the application of POEGMA technology to the aptamer based ROA described here will allow for an effective therapeutic that does not suffer from a harmful interaction with pre existing anti PEG antibodies  Reformulating this aptamer ROA represents a useful application of the POEGMA technology  as there is an unmet clinical need for anticoagulants that can be rapidly reversed  Currently  approximately    million Americans per year require intravenous infusion of a highly potent  rapid onset anticoagulant to perform clinical procedures that are highly prothrombotic  including percutaneous coronary intervention  PCI   angioplasty    coronary artery bypass graft  CABG  surgery and other surgeries  as well as dialysis  Significant disadvantages of current FDA approved ROAs unfractionated heparin  UFH   lepirudin  bivalirudin and argatroban have prompted efforts to identify ROAs that eliminate the toxicity and drug induced bleeding associated with these ROAs  The PEG aptamer sequence described here  together with the complementary antidote sequence capable of titrating and rapidly reversing anticoagulant activity  has been evaluated in andgt       patients in Phase    Phase   and Phase   clinical trials  with phase   studies suggesting that this aptamer antidote pair can reduce ischemic events and limit bleeding in PCI patients compared to heparin  Based on these promising results  we propose to eliminate the potential for the negative anti PEG interactions that have stopped the development of this once promising PEG aptamer therapeutic by developing a POEGMA aptamer conjugate    NARRATIVE Twelve million Americans per year require intravenous infusion of a highly potent  rapid onset anticoagulant  ROA  in order to receive treatment with a number of clinical procedures that are highly prothrombotic  including percutaneous coronary intervention  PCI   angioplasty    coronary artery bypass graft  CABG  surgery and other surgeries  as well as dialysis  Significant disadvantages of the FDA approved ROAs  unfractionated heparin  UFH   lepirudin  bivalirudin and argatroban  have prompted efforts to identify ROAs that eliminate the toxicity and drug induced bleeding associated with these approved ROAs  A recently developed PEG aptamer ROA showed promising results toward the goal of a more controlled treatment until trials were halted due to severe allergic reactions caused by interactions of the PEG aptamer with pre existing anti PEG antibodies  This application proposes to eliminate the negative interaction of this promising aptamer therapeutic with anti PEG antibodies by developing  PEG like  POEGMA conjugates that do not interact with anti PEG

The front panel and blackbody cavity temperatures are controlled independently of each other. The blackbody cavity simulator system is hooked up to a PC which controls and maintains all the thermal parameters during the tests.  During the Phase I study, (a) the blackbody cavity geometry will be optimized to produce an effective emissivity as close to unity as possible and (b)a proof-of-concept sub-scale engineering test unit will be built and tested.

The strong genetic association between specific MHC class II alleles, such as HLA-DR molecules containing the shared epitope, and susceptibility to RA provides support to a mechanism in which disease-associated MHC molecules selectively activate CD4 T cells. The hypothesis of this project is that small molecules that block T cell receptor (TCR):HLA-DR-peptide complex formation can prevent autoreactive T cell activation and chronic inflammatory processes in the affect joints. The investigator has developed sensitive screening assays to detect TCR:HLA-DR-peptide interactions and methods to produce sufficient amounts of soluble and functional TCR and HLA-DR-peptide reagents to support analysis of libraries of small molecules. Preliminary studies with another TCR:HLA-peptide pair demonstrate that compounds that specifically inhibit HLA activity in vitro and in vivo can be identified using these screening methods. The specific aims of the project are to further develop high-throughput screening assays to identify and characterize small molecules that inhibit TCR:HLA-DR-peptide interactions, to examine a large and diverse collection of small molecules for inhibitory activity and to test the immunosuppressive effects of these compounds in T cell-based assays.

The goals of this transition are to achieve increased asset availability and to lower maintenance costs by decreasing unplanned downtime through optimally planned condition-based scheduling.   Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have conclusively demonstrated in laboratory testing and field deployments that AI/ML methods of statistical reasoning on machine parameters of vibration, temperature, and current can predict machine maintenance requirements. Current deployment of these predictive capabilities requires significant investments in powerful computational infrastructure, precision sensing, and advanced software analyzing the sensor readings. Today’s technology options for each layer in this system are prohibitively expensive for broad deployment of the capability. Given that maintenance cost increases are the fundamental challenge to readiness cited by CNO and other leaders, the path to achieving broadly available machine health, usage, and monitoring (HUM) cannot be implemented on prohibitively expensive hardware that is currently available.

This project will develop a novel test device for subjecting RF structures at 34.272 GHz to high thermo-mechanical stress with pulsed temperature rises as high as 500Â¿C.  The device would allow structure lifetime tests to be conducted in a relatively short time, thereby evaluating the suitability of various materials and fabrication processes for future long-life high-gradient accelerators.  In Phase I, detailed analytical and numerical studies to optimize design of the 34.272 GHz demountable rf cavity for pulse surface heating tests were carried out, and a cold-test version of the cavity was built and tested.  Design features were incorporated that suppress RF breakdown, to allow for a clear evaluation of the effects on cavity surface degradation from thermo-mechanical surface stress.

In Phase I, the feasibility of this innovative technology was successfully demonstrated and key device design and material processing parameters to address underlying device performance were identified. Specific developments included (1) nanomaterial deposition (2) contact technology (3) doping processes and (4) device architecture. Phase II research will build on the knowledge gained in Phase I, and focus on further optimization of device performance and the development of roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. The output of Phase II will be a prototype array of transistors on plastic.

A key component of our UWB array is that it has a wide angle scan capability that is critical to achieving uninterrupted communication on the move. We showed that it could scan from zenith down to at least 15 degrees above the horizon, superior to any existing phase array designs. Our design also features a single PCB (RT/Duroid) and a standard-size coaxial feeding cable with feature sizes that can be manufactured with advanced PCB manufacturing techniques.     In Phase II, we will further optimize/refine the array design and demonstrate its key performance parameters such the bandwidth, wide scan angle, polarization, etc. on a prototype array with measurements at the anechoic chamber. We will also develop a roadmap for low-cost mass-fabrication of the array for faster transition to the market.    BENEFIT:  The proposed research and development offers a new design paradigm in developing conformal wideband low-profile antennas. We anticipate that the proposed technology will lead to low-cost and low-profile antenna solutions for high speed data communication links on aircrafts.

An in-line monitoring system that can test the fuel for particulate matter and condensed water would be of great benefit both to military and commercial aviation. In-line sampling during the fueling process represents the most favorable approach since fueling can be terminated immediately upon detection of contaminants including particulate matter and water.

However, commercial development of such processes has been hindered, in part, because the excessive heat released by alkane oxidation causes over-oxidation (burning) of a significant amount of the oxide catalysts.  These catalysts have inherently small surface areas and poor thermal conductivity, and are not able to dissipate the heat.  In order to reduce regional over-heating and enhance selectivity to the oxygenate products, this project will design and develop a high-surface-area thermally-conductive material for use as a support for metal oxide catalysts.  In Phase I, a nano-scale, high-surface-area, thermally stable and conductive material was designed, prepared, and characterized.  This material was used as a support for a model metal oxide catalyst and tested in a model alkane oxidation.  Significant enhancement in oxygenate selectivity was observed, as compared with conventional support materials or unsupported catalyst.  Phase II will optimize the preparation of the novel support material and demonstrate its application in the selective oxidation of several alkanes.  Catalytic testing will be conducted to measure the enhancement in oxygenate selectivity as compared with conventional support materials and the unsupported metal oxide catalysts.

In fact, a cryptophycin synthetic analogue has demonstrated promise in treating platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Despite this impressive activity, the development of the cryptophycins into a beneficial cancer chemotherapeutic agent has suffered due to clinically significant peripheral neuropathy that correlates with treatment. However, the promising therapeutic spectrum of these natural products has motivated Alluvium Biosciences to pursue the continued discovery and development of a cryptophycin compound that that can enter clinical evaluation. To this end, Alluvium is currently developing a high throughput, solid-phase chemoenzymatic production technology to enable access to structurally diverse cryptophycin compounds that can be readily screened for desirable pharmacological properties. Key to this effort is the availability of four chemical fragments, or units, which are assembled on solid-phase and subsequently biocatalytically transformed into mature cryptophycin compounds. Three of the required units are either commercially available or can be readily obtained by simple synthetic methods, while the fourth unit, 4- hydroxy phenyloctenoic acid, must currently be generated by custom synthetic strategies that result in low overall yields and high cost per compound. To add value to its cryptophycin chemoenzymatic production technology, Alluvium Biosciences is motivated to develop a low-cost, high yielding solution for the production of 4-hydroxy phenyloctenoic acid. Accordingly, in this Phase I SBIR proposal, Alluvium Biosciences will develop a novel biosynthetic technology that employs bacterial fermentation to produce this critical cryptophycin polyketide intermediate. Specifically, the proposed strategy aims to design and engineer a biosynthetic pathway, comprised of known cryptophycin biosynthetic enzymes, which will direct the biosynthesis of 4- hydroxy phenyloctenoic acid within an E. coli bacterial host. Subsequent to the construction and transfer of the engineered biosynthetic pathway into the bacterial host, fermentation conditions will be established for the production of the desired cryptophycin intermediate. Once proof-of-concept is demonstrated, Phase II research efforts will focus on further refinement of the genetically engineered bacterial strain and transfer of the fermentation technology toward a large-scale production system for the low-cost generation of 4-hydroxy phenyloctenoic acid. Efforts in Phase II will also develop strategies for the biosynthetic production of chemically diverse 4-hydroxy phenyloctenoic acid analogues. Purified 4-hydroxy phenyloctenoic acid, and structural analogues, produced by this fermentation technology will serve as starting material for the scalable production of desirable cryptophycin compounds via Alluvium's solid-phase chemoenzymatic technology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer represents a significant global human health concern that justifies substantial research investments for the discovery and development of novel treatments. Cryptophycin is a known, potent anti-cancer compound that has been dropped from clinical testing due to intolerable side-effects. This proposed research seeks to aid in the development of a novel technology for the rapid generation of cryptophycin analogues that may display fewer side effects, thereby enabling cryptophycin to be utilized by physicians in the battle against this oft-deadly disease.",MICHAEL BROWNSTEIN,,(734) 276-4921,,JEFFREY KITTENDORF,,(734) 276-4921,JEFF.KITTENDORF@ALLUVIUMBIO.COM,,,,"['low-cost', 'cost compound', 'condition', 'applicant', 'biosynthetic technology', 'large-scale production system', 'structural analogue', 'solution', 'solid-phase chemoenzymatic production technology', 'cancer', 'platinum resistant ovarian cancer', 'technology', 'production', 'development', 'synthetic method', 'display effect', 'natural product', 'clinical evaluation', 'therapeutic spectrum natural product', 'throughput', 'construction transfer', 'clinically significant', 'bacterial host', 'oft-deadly disease', 'clinical testing', 'anti-cancer compound', 'treatment', 'design', 'synthetic analogue', 'anticancer activity', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemoenzymatic production', 'public', 'research', 'Alluvium solid-phase chemoenzymatic technology', 'side-effect', 'phase', 'assemble solid-phase', 'pharmacological property', 'health']"

In addition, the application of SRF cavities for the manipulation of beam properties in the transverse plane finds more and more applications. The use of superconducting structures allows very high deflecting fields in a compact structure, highly desirable feature for applications involving manipulations of the charged particle beams at the point of delivery, such as Final Focus (FF) point. Using superconducting deflecting structures in future SRF accelerators allows for further increases of the interactions of existing colliding beams, and hence the overall machine performance. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been gradually upgrading its performance since its commissioning in 2009. LHC will be at the energy frontier in high energy physics for many years to come. Even before initial commissioning, plans have been under discussion for an upgrade, in particular toward an increase of its luminosity. One avenue that has been under discussion is the introduction of a bunch deflecting scheme (also called a crabbing scheme) to restore the luminosity lost due the finite crossing angle. The Large Hadron Collider has identified SRF deflecting cavities as a way to increase luminosity for the upcoming High-Luminosity (HiLumi) Upgrade.

The proposed device will address the current need for a more sensitive hearing screening tool by stimulating at lower levels and providing bone conduction stimulation in order to differentiate between sensorineural and conductive components. Intelligent Hearing Systems has previously developed a Stimulus Intensity-Ramping Technique for quickly determining frequency specific AEP hearing thresholds. This technique will be expanded and combined with bone conduction testing using various approaches, including: A) Interweaving Air-Bone stimulation, B) Dual-Rate Air-Bone stimulation and C) Overlapping Air-Bone Intensity-Ramping Stimulation. A new generation of high fidelity bone-conduction stereo headphones will be used to deliver stimuli.  During Phase I, the current software and hardware of the IHS hearing screening device will be modified to accommodate the proposed dual-ear simultaneous air and bone conduction testing paradigm. Experiments will be conducted to determine the feasibility of combining these testing paradigms and to determine their effectiveness and efficiency. Data will be collected from 10 young adults with normal hearing and 15 newborns. Newborns will be tested in order to determine the feasibility of the proposed technique on the target population. During Phase II, a comprehensive clinical study will be conducted on newborns. This new approach will allow for better management of hearing loss cases and implementation of more efficient rescreening policies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Newborn hearing screening is an important assessment tool in the early identification of infants hearing loss.

However, the cooling requirements make them bulky and unsuitable for many DOD applications. We propose two novel approaches to increase their operating temperature. In the first approach, we will demonstrate p-d-n equilibrium HgCdTe detectors. Because of the lack of symmetry between the valence and conduction bands in HgCdTe, the lifetimes in d-type material are higher than those in n-type layers.  The challenge of implementing a p-d-n HgCdTe detector is to obtain low p-type doping in the absorber region. Arsenic will be introduced by a novel technique based on implantation and diffusion by thermal annealing.  In the second approach, p-d-n devices developed in the first approach will be operated under non-equilibrium conditions. In non-equilibrium operation the minority carriers are extracted to one side of the active area of a detector and the contact to the other side prevents their replenishment. As a consequence, the carrier concentration is decreased dramatically. This leads to increases in recombination lifetimes, dynamic impedances and detectivities.   To implement these two approaches, we propose to use HgCdTe infrared materials grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) directly on large area (3-5"") silicon substrates with CdTe buffer layers.",Sivalingam Sivananthan,President,(630) 771-0201,siva@epir.com,Silviu Velicu,Senior Engineer,(630) 771-0203,svelicu@epir.com,,,,"['p-type', 'sensitivity', 'operating temperature', 'active area detector', 'molecular beam epitaxy', 'n-type layer', 'p-d-n equilibrium hgcdte detector', 'application', 'dynamic impedance', 'buffer layer', 'non-equilibrium operation minority carrier extract', 'conduction band HgCdTe', 'non-equilibrium condition', 'diffusion thermal annealing', 'consequence', 'silicon', 'p-d-n device', 'wavelength']"

On wing repairs cannot exceed 300F cure temperatures. MATECH proposes to demonstrate its high ceramic yield, fully domestic, solvent less preceramic polymer resins, as the preferred resin system for field repair. These resins can be fully cured at below 300F, thereby meeting the on wing temperature requirement. This resin also emits limited gaseous by-products during curing. Higher temperature&quot;pyrolysis&quot;can be performed either by utilizing engine heat (for engine and exhaust components) or in flight (for leading edge components). In the Phase I, MATECH demonstrated this approach by measuring CMC strength before and after the simulated repair of&quot;near catastrophic&quot;matrix damage in a large scale CMC system. The damaged CMC flexural strength and modulus properties were fully restored to equal (and above) those of the&#039;as received&#039;CMCs. The technique used for the simulated repair will be amenable to an operational field application environment (flight line or hanger). This Phase II program benefits from the active support and participation of Lockheed Martin(Fort Worth, TX), GE Aviation (Cincinnati, OH), and General Atomics (San Diego, CA).  BENEFIT:  Ceramic and ceramic matrix composite will be increasingly utilized in both military and commercial aircraft engines and turbine generators, along with other applications requiring high service temperature components, due to their light weight and higher service temperature capabilities.

What started as a problem primarily associated with hospital-acquired Enterococcus infections, has  not only moved into the general community, but also grown to include a number of widespread and serious pathogens. Drug-resistant Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enterococci and Pseudomonas strains are quite common. Currently as many as 70% of hospital-acqui red infections in the US are resistant to at least one antibiotic, and about 40% of S. aureus infections are multidrug-resistant. Even drugs like Vancomycin and Teicoplanin, which for years represented the  agents of last resort  for treatment of antibioti cs-resistant infections, are no longer efficacious against certain pathogen strains. The loss of efficacy of these compounds leaves very few treatment options for patients with multi-drug resistant infections. Clearly, there is an immediate unmet need for  new antibiotics with novel modes of action. Moreover, the overall market for antibacterial drugs is large and growing - world-wide sales reached  30 billion in 2006. Early published data suggest that empedopeptin, a cyclic peptide produced by Empedobacter  haloabium, has considerable potency towards a wide range of Gram positive organisms, in vitro. This data also suggest that the compound is well tolerated in mice and quite efficacious against systemic infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyog enes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nonetheless, although discovered over 20 years ago, empedopeptin has not been developed into a commercial product. A recent, in vitro evaluation of empedopeptin has revealed that the compound also has significant potency  against most contemporary, drug-resistant, Gram-positive organisms, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), meticillin-resistant S. epidermis (MRSE) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Together with the published animal data, this suggests  that empedopeptin may have the properties required for development into a drug for the treatment of infections caused by today's antibiotics-resistant organisms. However, a lack of patent protection together and somewhat high MIC values towards several pa thogens currently constitutes a barrier to development of the compound. The overall goal of the project outlined in this proposal is to use of a genetic engineering approach to generate novel derivatives of the antibacterial compound empedopeptin. This wil l allow improvement of the compound's therapeutic properties, as well as creation of an intellectual property situation that is compatible with commercial development of the compound as a drug for the treatment of antibiotics-resistant bacterial infections . However, an absolute prerequisite for any genetic engineering-mediated structural modifications of empedopeptin is availability of the corresponding (currently unknown) biosynthesis gene. Consequently, the goal of Phase I is to identify, isolate and char acterize this gene. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The drastic increase in multi-drug resistant infections, during last two decades, has generated an immediate unmet need for new antibacterial drugs with novel modes of action. The proposed project will add a pot ent, efficacious, well-tolerated and economical antibacterial drug to a currently quite limited inventory of compounds with efficacy towards a broad range of clinically relevant drug- and multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens.", ,,(269) 353-3805,ake.p.elhammer@aureogen.com,AKE ELHAMMER,,(269) 353-3805,AKE.P.ELHAMMER@AUREOGEN.COM,,,,"['inventory compound', 'applicant', 'mic value', 'genetic engineering', 'drug treatment infection', 'market', 'structural modification', 'Enterococci pseudomonas strain', 'antibacterial compound', 'development', 'multi-drug resistant infection', 'project', 'drug treatment', 'antibiotics-resistant', 'intellectual property', 'pathogen strain', 'mode action', 'property', 'patient', 'therapeutic property', 'treatment', 'compound significant', 'hospital-acquired enterococcus infection', 'problem', 'goal phase', 'antibiotics-resistant bacterial infection', 'lack patent protection', 'meticillin-resistant s. epidermis', 'public health', 'availability', 'loss efficacy compound', 'multi-drug resistant', 'cs-resistant infection']"

Of these cases, the vast majority were solid tumors, accounting for more than 16 million new cases and 8 million cancer deaths. This includes soft tissue sarcoma (STS), a heterogeneous group of aggressive malignant tumors that have a poor 5-year survival rate of only 65%. In the U.S., an estimated 13,000 people will be diagnosed with STS in 2020, and more than 5,000 will die of the disease. For patients diagnosed with STS, treatment often involves chemotherapy with a cytotoxic agent such as doxorubicin (Dox), an anthracycline that has been used to induce tumor regression in a variety of neoplastic conditions. Dox is also known to induce immunogenic cell death and enhance tumor responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Unfortunately, the extended use of Dox in patients is limited by severe toxic side effects—most notably irreversible cardiotoxicity and bone marrow suppression—which can be life threatening. Therefore, there is an immediate need for new methods to reduce the systemic toxicity and off-target effects of Dox while maintaining its antitumor efficacy Shasqi has developed SQ3370, a novel drug product that will improve the treatment of patients with injectable solid tumors undergoing doxorubicin (Dox)-based chemotherapy. Preclinical studies done to-date have shown that SQ3370 results in significant inhibition of tumor growth (both injected and non-injected tumors), immune activation, prolonged survival, and protection against tumor rechallenge, while exhibiting reduced systemic side effects compared to conventional Dox. Extensive preclinical data with SQ3370 has led to an open investigational new drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Currently, the Navy has no viable capability for measuring range and cross winds onboard an LCAC.  CTI proposes to develop a low-cost,compact, rugged, eyesafe laser wind sensor to meet the Navy LCAC measurement requirements.  This sensor will significantly increase the efficacy of LCAC mine clearing operations, resulting in considerable cost savings.  Phase 1 performance modelingsuggests that a low power (250 mW) sensor will be capable of range and cross wind velocity estimation precision better than 4 and 15 cm/s respectively, at a 1 Hz update rate.  System degradation by as much as 20 dB from fog, rain, sea-spray, etc. resultsin a measurement precision that still meets requirements.  In the proposed Phase II program, CTI plans to build and test a brassboard version of this sensor and demonstrate performance under simulated LCAC environmental conditions.  The low-cost,short-range sensor, developed in this effort, will provide 2 km high and 6 to 10 km wide dome coverage complementing CTI's long-range WindTracerr product line.  Cost reductions will be realized by leveraging significant ongoing activities to develop alow-cost wind sensor for clear-air-turbulence detection onboard commercial aircraft. The proposed program will result in the development of a low-cost, compact, eye-safe, air-cooled laser transceiver for short-range wind velocity measurements.  Thistechnology will have application in many military as well as commercial settings.  Potential commercial applications include general aviation wind shear detection, airport wind surveillance, and environmental monitoring.  Military markets include the LCAC,onboard wind sensing for military aircraft in the deployment of supplies (precision airdrop), as well as an onboard systems for gunships and helicopters to improve ballistics accuracy (ballistics winds).

Although SAH represents only 5-10% of strokes, its impact is proportionally much higher because SAH patients are typically younger (mean age is 50 years) than other stroke patients. Nearly half of SAH patients die from either the initial hemorrhage or secondary complications that are caused by SAH-induced vasospasm. The only approved pharmaceutical for SAH-induced vasospasm is the calcium channel antagonist Nimotop (nimodipine). Although Nimotop significantly improves the outcome of surviving patients, it does not alter the incidence or magnitude of vasospasm and does not decrease mortality. Thus, there is a significant unmet clinical need for an agent to address SAH-induced vasospasm. Pharmacologic vasorelaxants, which activate cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways that converge at the phosphorylation of the small heat shock-related protein HSP20 are largely ineffective for treating SAH. We have recently determined that SAH-induced vasospasm is associated with down regulation of HSP20. This finding may explain why pharmacological vasorelaxants are ineffective in the treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm; the downstream protein effector molecule is not available to be activated. More importantly, we have determined that a single intrathecal injection of the HSP20 phosphopeptide analogue, 24 hours after the SAH, completely inhibits vasospasm. The goal of this Phase II project is to commercially develop a proteomic-based therapeutic to prevent SAH-induced vasospasm by directly injecting analogs of an endogenous relaxing protein (HSP20) in to the cerebrospinal fluid. Proteomic-based approaches deliver proteins/peptides into cells by fusing protein transduction domains (PTDs, ""carriers"") to biologically active molecules (""cargo""). The Phase I project demonstrated that HSP20 analogs are effective at relaxing smooth muscle from a variety of species in vitro. The specific aims of this proposal are to conduct safety testing of PTD-HSP20 analogs in vivo prior to advancement into phase I clinical trials. Since there is currently no effective agent for the treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm, this proteomic treatment would have significant therapeutic potential. This product utilizes a ""post-genomic"" platform for engineering biologically active protein/peptide molecules and has the potential to be the first proteomic-based pharmaceutical.",,,(602) 300-1649,COLLEEN.BROPHY@ASU.EDU,COLLEEN BROPHY,,(602) 391-8515,COLLEEN.BROPHY@ASU.EDU,,,,"['small heat shock-related protein', 'effective', 'clinical trial', 'applicant', 'advancement phase', 'proteomic-based', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'proteins/peptide cell fuse protein transduction domain', 'biologically active molecule', 'agent', 'intrathecal injection', 'safety', 'project', 'secondary complication', 'die', 'patient', 'treatment', 'need agent', 'regulation', 'goal phase', 'nucleotide-dependent signaling pathway', 'proteomic-based approach', 'phase project', 'protein/peptide molecule potential', 'outcome', 'vasospasm calcium channel antagonist nimotop', 'clinical', 'proteomic treatment']"

These structures are subjected to repeated large dynamic loads that are highly variable in nature.  In order to track these structures&quot;fatigue over time, the magnitude and direction of load events and the number of fatigue cycles must be recorded.  Smart, embedded multi-directional load sensors can provide this information.    We propose to demonstrate this capability by combining a network of time-synchronized wireless load sensors with integrated microelectronics for static and dynamic loads sensing, data recording, communications, and energy harvesting.  Our sensors possess major advantages, including: sealed stainless packaging, full calibration prior to installation, and rapid installation without modification to existing landing gear structures to enable full computation of landing gear forces and moments.      Embedded firmware within a wireless sensor data aggregator (WSDA) will automatically detect landing gear deployment, and each node will commence high speed, time synchronized data recording.  Data shall be collected prior to, during, and after landing by the WSDA.  In Phase II, the WSDA will be programmed to host fatigue algorithms.  Energy management combined with energy harvesting will be included to eliminate sensor node battery maintenance.    BENEFIT:  Our proposed wireless sensors are small, completely self-contained, and may be calibrated independently of the landing gear structure.  They may be installed on existing landing gear without any modifications to the gear itself.  Working system demonstrations under this SBIR program will lead to significant opportunities aboard Air Force, Navy, Army, Marines, Coast Guard, civil, and commercial aircraft.

Inserting pins at the proper location can achieve high enough pressures on the body of a projectile or missile to produce high speed turns.

This is stemmed, among other factors, by the broad movement range, flexibility, and small footprint of these robots. However, when it comes to high-payload operations, gantry robots, with their rigid construct, are still the option of choice. This is particularly true when precision is of concern. Unfortunately, a rigid gantry setup is difficult to implement in space especially considering weight constraints and the need for flexibility. Modular robotic kinematic systems offer process flexibility and diversity. Robotic kinematic systems are already being used for in-space applications. This proposal is aimed at developing a machine learning-based software solution that would allow for high-precision, high-payload manufacturing operations to be carried out autonomously using multiple articulated robots. The work targets robotic sheet metal forming, which given its versatility and simplicity is an ideal operation for both on-ground and in-space manufacturing/repair of metal parts. The robotic forming cell consists of two heterogenous, 6-axis robots mounted on two linear tracks and a real-time monitoring and control system. The robots must work in coordination with each other to incrementally form a sheet of metal into a part based on an input CAD file. This work introduces a software solution which addresses a number of challenges. First, both robots need to be synced while experiencing differing loading conditions imposed by the forming operation (e.g., due to variation in friction). Second, the positioning of the two robots need to be dynamically adjusted to make sure the overall compliance of the robotic system is minimized. Third, the system monitors the forming operation in real-time and assesses its deviation against the initially defined path. The feedback from the monitoring system needs to be actively used to update the predefined path.",Babak Raeisinia,raeisinia,(770) 769-0114,br@machinalabs.ai,Babak Raeisinia,,(770) 769-0114,br@machinalabs.ai,,,,"['high-precision', 'in-space manufacturing/repair', 'robotic system', 'operation', 'robotic kinematic system', 'machine', 'modular robotic kinematic system', 'monitoring system', 'application', 'process', 'variation friction', 'robot work', 'metal', 'manufacturing operation sector', 'loading condition', 'operation real-time assess deviation', 'high-payload operation', 'in-space', 'metal base', 'positioning robot', 'system', 'software solution', 'diversity', 'linear track real-time monitoring control system', 'stem', 'learning-based software solution', 'high-payload manufacturing operation', 'factor']"

Our goal in this program is to develop an optical imaging technique capable of identifying specific chemical compounds in vivo in the retina with cellular-level resolution, non-invasively, and without the use of contrast agents. We will validate the ability of this technique to identify early indications of AD on mice first in Phase I as a proof-of-principle demonstration, and then on humans in Phase II.Although AD cannot yet be treated with the intent to cure, sufficiently early diagnosis will facilitate intervention with available therapeutics, adding years of productive quality time to the patientandapos;s life. However, the lack of suitable diagnostic tools for both in vivo rapid screening of Aβ aggregation and early detection of AD pathology poses severe limitations. Current available structural, functional, and metabolic brain imaging methods are not yet suitable for repeated population screening in the preclinical stages. They are either limited by the use of unsafe ionizing isotopes (radioactivity), involve high costs, have low availability, and provide reduced resolution or specificity. An alternative non-invasive approach to visualize Aβ plaques in AD patients could be high-resolution optical imaging of the retina, knowing that Aβ plaques form in retinal layers and share properties with those in the brain.The retina, as an extension of the brain, is the only part of the central nervous system that can be imaged non-invasively at sub-cellular resolutions. Human postmortem histopathological studies have shown accumulation of Aβ in the retinas of those with confirmed AD, principally in the inner-retinal layers. Studies of transgenic mouse models of AD have demonstrated the presence of retinal Aβ and shown quantitative and temporal correlations between brain and retinal Aβ deposition. Most of the in vivo retinal imaging techniques involved fluorescence imaging based on curcumin as a fluorescence tag or on hyperspectral imaging. However, so far, no in vivo retinal imaging technique involving spectral analysis provided cellular-level resolution and no high-resolution retinal imaging instrument possessed spectral discrimination. PSI proposes to develop a multispectral adaptive optics-based non-invasive optical imaging technique that will enable in vivo cellular-level resolution for early detection of Aβ presence in the retina and will facilitate a path to understanding the onset of various neurodegenerative diseases. We will build on our expertise in high-resolution retinal imaging and spectral analysis.Project NarrativeSignificant development in retinal imaging over the last two decades confirmed that amyloid deposits that are the hallmark of Alzheimerandapos;s diseases (AD) can be detected in the retina before they develop in the brain and affect cognitive functions.

Our data show GRSA expression is a feature common to all, or most, breast cancers and DCIS. I also shows GRSA-like antigens can be targeted in patients with antibodies, and that our MAG-1 monoAb not only recognizes GRSA in all of breast tumors but also targets GRSA in vitro. Preliminary findings also indicate MAG-1 and 90Yttrium-labeled MAG-1 can decrease growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. Phase 1 goals are directed towards (i) performing and completing a 'proof of principle' to determine the usefulness of ""technetium-labeled Fab fragments of mouse monoclonal antibody (mMAG-1) to successfully image breast cancer tumor xenografts in nu/nu mice, and; (ii) performing and completing a 'proof of principle' determine if MAG-1 (mMAG-1) or 90Yttrium-labeled mMAG-1 can kill or significantly retard the growth of brea tumor xenografts in nu/nu mice.

Inhalational and gastrointestinal infection with Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) can cause an inflammatory reaction leading to multisystem organ failure and death. Various clinical cues and diagnostic tests are used to confirm suspected anthrax infection, and it is likely that emerging molecular diagnostic techniques will yield more accurate and quicker confirmation of anthrax infection. However, all diagnostic modalities fail in one crucial respect: while they identify the presence of anthrax infection, they do not point to the status of the individual patient nor do they indicate how this person will fare in the immediate future. Drs. Vodovotz, Clermont, and Chow have developed a mathematical model incorporating cellular, molecular, and physiological details of the acute inflammatory responses to infection, and have begun to simulate the response to anthrax infection. This model can be used to predict an individual patient's course of disease, as well as to test the efficacy of a given intervention in a simulated clinical trial. Immunetrics, Inc., is in the process of commercializing the applications of this model to the treatment of sepsis, a healthcare problem affecting over 750,000 Americans each year with a cost of over $17 billion.

Yet this trend began to languish over the last decade. A law known as Dennard scaling, which states that microprocessors would proportionally increase in performance while keeping their power consumption constant, has broken down since about 2006; the result has been a trade-off between speed and power efficiency.

Recombinant proteins, though, have limited half-lives in vivo and require repeated injection or infusion, daily in some cases, to maintain efficacy. Through the use of gene transfer, it is possible to deliver cDNAs encoding such proteins to the synovial lining of joints and enable their persistent production and secretion for extended periods. To achieve this, we have been exploring the use of lentiviral vectors, which are capable of efficient and stable genetic modification of target cells in vivo. The unique abilities of this vector system make it an extremely promising candidate for direct intra-articular gene transfer for the treatment of chronic joint diseases. In pilot studies, we found that recombinant lentiviral vectors were capable of generating extraordinarily high levels of intra-articular transgene expression in the knees of rats, and enabled stable expression of a therapeutic gene product for at least 6 months. The current proposal requests funds to support further research and development of lentiviral vectors for a gene based therapy for arthritis. The study will address three issues central to consideration of commercial development: 1) therapeutic efficacy, 2) vector dosing in proportional target joints and 3) generation of a lentiviral packaging line for large-scale production. It is intended that the results of these studies will establish the feasibility of lentiviral mediated gene delivery for treatment of arthritis.",RONALD DORAZIO,,(617) 873-0903,RDORAIO@GENETIXPHARM.COM,STEVEN GHIVIZZANI,,(617) 732-8607,SGHIVIZZANI@RICS.BWH.HARVARD.EDU,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,,,"['genetic modification', 'research', 'gene transfer', 'therapy arthritis', 'production', 'gene delivery', 'applicant', 'generation', 'injection', 'treatment', 'vector system', 'chronic joint disease', 'persistent', 'expression', 'large-scale production', 'lentiviral packaging line', 'treatment arthritis', 'anti-arthritic property']"

By making use of Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) technology, which creates reactions between a re-circulating ion beam and a gas target, the limitations on lifetime of fusion sources that use solid targets can be overcome, while still possessing the advantages of being electronic.  Additionally, substantial improvements in neutron moderator efficiency are proposed that can relax the requirements on total output for isotropic sources, improving efficiency and decreasing leakage radiation.  Preliminary studies using the MCNPX code indicate that creative moderator designs can increase thermal neutron efficiency by over 50 times that from existing moderators.  The goal of this proposal is to increase IEC neutron production rates by a factor of 4 in phase I, and a factor of 5 in phase II to reach a final rate of > 1013 n/s.

Gene therapy offers a novel approach for the prevention and treatment of heart disease; however, the fundamental obstacle to improving current protocols is the development of vectors that exhibit high efficacy and specificity of gene and drug delivery. While significant advances have been made towards identifying tissue-specific targeting ligands for therapeutic compounds, these ligands have been limited almost exclusively to those that bind the vasculature of organ systems and tumors. We propose to use novel phage display technology to select for internalizing ligands that trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis, a biological process critical for the delivery of therapeutic agents. The goal is to use these ligands for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents directly to the heart. For example, the ability to target gene therapy vectors with cardio-specific ligands would have enormous commercial applications for the developing treatments for heart disease. In addition, cardio-specific ligands would be useful for identifying receptors specifically expressed in the myocardium, which can be used as valuable drug leads for future commercialization. Thus, the identification of ligands that specifically target the heart would provide new opportunities for improving current viral vectors, as well as the development of other cardio-specific vectors for the delivery of genes and other therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", ,,(858) 625-0100,,PEGGY FAIX,,(858) 793-6641,PEGFAIX@SELECTIVEGENETICS.COM,,,,"['gene therapy', 'cardiovascular disease', 'current protocol', 'biological process', 'myocardium', 'cardio-specific vector', 'applicant', 'delivery', 'viral vector', 'development', 'treatment', 'tissue-specific', 'bind', 'treatment heart disease', 'identification', 'heart']"

HIV can often be suppressed for many years with anti-retroviral medications, and over 15 billion dollars were spent on these medications in2010. Biologics such as HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) VRC01, PG9, and b12 and peptides such as Enfuvirtide are potent inhibitors of HIV and offer themselves as alternatives to standard small-molecule anti- retroviral medications, typically with fewer side effects. However, unlike small-molecule treatments, biologics typically have to be injected, and this need for injection can be problematic especially if the injections are frequent. For example, Enfuvirtide, the first FDA-approved biologic approved for treating HIV, requires twice- daily injections, and very frequently causes injection site reactions. Immusoft&#039;s proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the ability to induce secretion of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies from autologous human cell with a lentiviral vector. This treatment approach eliminates the need for frequent and often painful injections. It also offers the possibility of targeting the therapeutic biologic to certain tissues harboring cells with latent HIV infection. Theproposed study will achieve three mission goals for continuing to validate the commercial viability of the delivery system in vivo. Our first specific aim will define vector and culture media requirements necessary to most efficiently transduce and expandmodified immune cells. Our second specific aim will test for compatibility of the vector, and culture system with cells from the primate Macaca nemestrina in preparation for a phase II application. Our third specific aim will introduce modified cells intoan immunocompromised mouse to measure secretion of the HIV-neutralizing antibody VRC01. Overall, the goal of these experiments is to optimize the culture system conditions, and to estimate the numbers of cells required for a phase II study in a primate model. The phase II application will investigate long-term biologic production, cell homing, and system safety in vivo, as well as expand the number of HIV-targeting biologics to those that have shown the most promise in clinical trials. Given the very high-level conservation between human and monkey biology, we expect that the critical components comprising the system will translate well. In the event that it is not possible to utilize monkey cells, we intend to utilize humanized mice, for which we have ongoing collaborations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV is an incurable disease and a global epidemic affecting over 33.3 million people.

Due to tremendous advances in RO membrane materials and module design in the past 20 years, the technology has reached a productivity plateau in which further development will have far more muted impact on system capital and operating costs. As a result, the focus is shifting to the feed water pretreatment subsystems. Micro- or ultrafiltration (MF/UF) of the feedwater thus far has been recognized as one of the most reliable and environmentally friendly pretreatment methods. Although polymeric membranes dominate this sector due to their low cost, reasonable productivity, standardized package design, and ease of replacement, like RO membranes, the technology has reached a productivity plateau after decades of development. Ceramic membranes offer a range of performance advantages over polymeric competitors that make them a superior materials choice for long term performance and mechanical stability. However, sticker shock, coupled with poor standardization in element design, remain the primary barriers to their penetration into the RO pretreatment market and the broader MF/UF water treatment market. Overcoming these problems remains a significant challenge. Still, in comparison to highly optimized polymeric membrane fabrication and operation, there are a number of areas uniquely available to ceramic membrane technology where advanced manufacturing can be introduced to dramatically reduce fabrication cost, improve productivity, and ultimately deliver a cost competitive product. If these goals can be achieved, ceramic membranes will stand alone as the next generation technology for RO pretreatment. In this proposed Phase I effort, the focus will be to develop advanced manufacturing approaches in three specifically identified areas that reduce the cost of fabrication and increase operational performance and stability of ceramic membrane technology. The preliminary cost target is to reach parity with competing polymeric MF/UF membranes by the end of the Phase I program. However, the proposed approaches offer the potential to significantly drive the cost well below this level. Three advanced manufacturing strategies focusing on fabrication automation, standardization of the membrane packaged, and optimization surface properties will be pursued in Phase I. Large surface area membrane packages produced in Phase I will be challenge tested under extreme conditions to demonstrate performance and mechanical stability. The results will inform the program technical approach in the Phase II fabrication scaleup and field demonstration testing. A range of significant existing market opportunities exist for a low-cost high productivity ceramic ultrafiltration membrane technology. Although the RO pretreatment market is substantial, ultrafiltration is much more broadly used in a wide range of non-desalination applications. Further, due to its durability, reliability, and productivity, a low-cost ceramic membrane technology would open doors to broader acceptance and penetration of MF/UF membranes into much more challenging applications in for instance aggressive waste water, solvent, and oil recovery where no polymeric membranes are available.",Paul Liu,,(412) 292-4168,pliu@mediaandprocess.com,Richard Ciora,,(724) 294-0134,rciora@mediaandprocess.com,,,,"['water', 'parity', 'polymeric mf/uf membrane end phase program', 'ultrafiltration membrane technology', 'productivity plateau', 'operational performance', 'productivity', 'product', 'fabrication', 'recovery', 'pretreatment subsystem', 'reliability', 'market', 'global', 'manufacturing', 'technology', 'focus shift', 'feed water', 'module', 'program', 'development', 'performance', 'optimization', 'number area', 'comparison', 'couple poor standardization element design', 'technical approach phase', 'penetration', 'treatment', 'design', 'phase challenge test', 'pretreatment method', 'cost', 'problem', 'mechanical stability', 'potential', 'ceramic membrane technology open door', 'surface area', 'advanced manufacturing', 'sticker shock', 'productivity plateau decade', 'phase', 'long term', 'non-desalination', 'standardized package design', 'cost level']"

While computational modeling of fuel cells has been widespread in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and hydrogen-air proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) areas, it has been limited in the area of direct methanol fuel cell.  This can be attributed, in part, to the fact that in DMFC, since the liquid fuel produces gaseous products, the modeling necessitates careful consideration of two-phase phenomena, which is numerically challenging.   A comprehensive simulation tool for the prediction of performance of gas-feed PEMFC and SOFC have been developed and marketed. In order to capture the rapidly growing DMFC market, this project proposes to extend the simulation tool to address issues specific to liquid-feed DMFC modeling. The model will be validated against experimental data available from the literature.   Liquid-feed Direct Methanol Fuel Cells have become the center of attention, especially for portable power applications where optimal space utilization is critical.

This effort focuses on negative electrodes that include Si-based materials, where Si contributes at least 30% of the reversible capacity of the electrode. This effort will result in significantly longer cycle life and calendar life for LIBs that feature Si-containing negative electrodes. Recent work has shown that the capacity fade seen in well-designed Si and Si-based negative electrodes is a consequence of an increase in surface area with cycling as the Si-based material expands and contracts. The increased surface area results in an increase in parasitic side reactions and accelerated electrolyte consumption. High precision calorimetry combined with high precision coulometry allows an early identification of the increasing parasitic thermal power that accompanies the increasing surface area. The volume changes of Si-based materials can be diluted but they cannot be suppressed. The path forward for truly enabling Si-based materials therefore lies in targeted electrolyte chemistry. Electrolyte constituents that lead to the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) or CO2 precursors have recently been shown to be effective in extending the cycle life of Si. It is believed the presence of CO2, or readily reducible intermediates, leads to the formation of an inorganic carbonate Si SEI and has a remarkable effect on extending cycle life. Our Phase I results show that proprietary electrolytes and cell designs developed by Coulometrics & Cyclikal increase cycle life from 500 cycles for control cells to over 900 cycles.

However, this promise and potential has yet to be fully realized. One of the major challenges with exoskeletons is the interface between the exoskeleton and the human user – how can the (often rigid) exoskeleton be effectively and efficiently coupled to the (fleshy) human? Nature has effectively solved the flesh-to-exoskeleton problem in mollusks, turtles, armadillos, and insects (among others). Nature’s solutions have the potential to improve the coupling of exoskeletons to the warfighter. Creare proposes to develop a Bioinspired Exoskeleton Interface (BEI). The BEI adopts exoskeleton solutions found in nature, to improve the coupling between human and machine. These solutions offer improvements in load transfer, energy efficiency, and comfort while maintaining the wearer’s mobility.

We believe such a system will be useful for a wide range of applications but for this proposal we will concentrate on wild fire research, fire mapping and detection, detection of small cooking fires associated with illegal crops hidden in forest lands (&quot;narco-campfires&quot;), and disaster response in general. The proposed system is designed to operate autonomously at altitudes from 3,000 to 30,000 feet. For our notional operational concept we will use an altitude of 23,000 feet. In persistent stare mode, the aircraft operating at this altitude will circle a flight path approximately 6 miles in diameter (similar to a typical holding pattern). In this scenario, the Staring Wide Area Imager will scan and 8 mile diameter area on the ground, the imagery from the two or three spectral bands will be analyzed in real time for fire detection, the resulting image maps will be orthorectified in real time, compressed, and sent to the ground across a standard data communication link. In this scenario the system will provide multi-spectral imagery of this entire area, approximately 50 square miles, once a minute, with virtually no delay. The result will resemble a moving weather map commonly used by the TV weather folks to inform people of coming rain. We intend to do the same thing, but with fire. In mapping mode the system will function as an across track scanner. In this mode, operating from the notional altitude of 23,000 feet the system will map over 2000 square miles per hour (assumes an aircraft speed of 200 knots). Please note that this is just an example and the other altitudes and speeds will also work. For fire science work, we propose to configure the system with three bands: LWIR (8 to 9 um), MWIR (4 - 5 um), and (funds permitting) a SWIR band around 1.6 um. Each of these sensors will have a 600 urad instantaneous field of view producing a ground sample distance of approximately 14 feet from our notional operating altitude of 23,000 feet. At this altitude the system will be capable of detecting a 6 inch by 6 inch 600 degree C fire.

Suppression of HOMs represents a significant challenge for current and future accelerators, particularly high peak and/or average current machines such as Free Electron Lasers (FEL) and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL), which have kW- levels of estimated HOM power per cavity. While current HOM RF absorber materials have satisfied the requirements for cryogenic and room temperature operation; robust, low-cost manufacturing technologies which can generate large area RF absorbers are needed for future high current accelerators. This proposal outlines a method to fabricate novel Al/SiC metal matrix composites for use as an RF absorber using cold spray technology. This process can be used to directly bond full density absorbers onto the inside of large, water-cooled beam line absorbers. The low temperatures associated with cold spray can result in the formation of nanostructured, non-equilibrium phases with enhanced microwave absorbing properties. We performed coupon level spray trials using 2 separate cold spray vendors, then metallographically examined the coatings. We down selected the best vendor and cold sprayed the inside of a brazed, 80 mm diameter copper vacuum assembly, followed by inspection and post-spray machining. The particulate, RF and vacuum characteristics of the assembly were measured. While we observed ceramics particles in the coating, initial 3GHz pillbox results show a metal-like coating behavior. With this proof of principle demonstration, we plan to coat the inside diameter of a large (~12”) beam line absorber (BLA), such as those required for the electron storage ring (eSR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). In Phase II, RadiaBeam will fabricate an EIC-sized BLA copper/stainless steel housing, performing the required dimensional and vacuum checks. In year I, we will perform coupon-level cold spray development to maximize the RF absorption of our coating. In year 2, we will cold spray the inside diameter of the EIC BLA assembly, then test the RF, particulate and vacuum properties of this full-scale device. This work is to be performed with support from Jefferson National Lab, who will provide guidance on the design, fabrication, RF measurement and data analysis. Cold spray HOM absorbers could reduce the capital and operational costs associated with superconducting RF accelerators via low-costs RF absorbers and optimized cryogenic thermal management, respectively. This novel, low-temperature powder consolidation process enables the fabrication of non-equilibrium materials which have received significant interests for corrosion and wear applications. With additional development, these composite materials can be similarly engineered to have specific RF properties.

The current state of assays designed to examine mutation and carcinogenic mechanisms are especially limited by their high costs and low throughput capacities. This laboratory has developed a gene mutation assay that is based on the endogenous Pig-a gene. The Pig-a gene product is essential for the biosynthesis of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Mutations giving rise to nonfunctional GPI anchors prevent certain proteins from being expressed on the cell surface, and this represents a phenotype that can be measured by flow cytometry. The work proposed herein will extend our development efforts by creating a suite of assays that represent a platform for studying a key mode of carcinogenic action, mutation. By devising Pig-a based methods that examine cells in culture, laboratory rodents, and human subjects, a truly comprehensive bridging biomarker will be realized. The bridging capabilities and high throughput nature of the proposed mutation assessment tools will contribute significantly to important areas of research that include academic, regulatory, and industrial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The ability to efficiently and comprehensively study mutation, a key pathway of carcinogenesis, is critical for gaining insight into this complex disease, and for elucidating carcinogens&#039; mode of action.

Thousands of sudden events, such as vehicle impacts and overweight vehicle crossings, occur annually on the over 700,000 bridges in the U.S. Many go unnoticed or unreported, despite their potential to induce structural failures or hidden damage that significantly reduces the structure's service life. This project will provide a cost-effective wireless solution to detect, quantify, and report sudden events on civil infrastructure in near real-time. The proposed solution will replace three existing types of monitoring systems with one compact, easy-to-deploy device at a fraction of the cost of even a single legacy system. The rapid condition assessment capability will further reduce traffic disruption, thereby lowering daily economic losses that can range in the millions of dollars and offering the potential to make the nation's transportation infrastructure safer. The proposed project seeks to develop a smart IoT monitoring system for rapid condition assessment of civil infrastructure under sudden events. Wired systems are prohibitively expensive for most structures, particularly bridges in remote locations, and existing wireless solutions following a duty-cycle approach to reduce power draw are incapable of always-on monitoring needed for sudden event detection. The objective of the research is to develop a low-cost IoT system to maintain always-on monitoring, so as not to miss an event, under a minimal power budget, without sacrificing data fidelity, and with a very low false positive rate. To this end, an asynchronously-triggered, synchronized data acquisition method will be developed, using high-fidelity wireless sensors that are tightly coupled with a programmable event-based switch capable of always-on operation. This method would enable the system to maintain ultralow-power operation indefinitely, and upon event detection, to rapidly transition to high-fidelity measurement. Uniquely, the pre- and post-event data are processed and stitched together across multiple sensors without the need for a priori synchronization. Experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the system?s capabilities to capture the onset of sudden events and present structural damage assessment in near real-time.

These impurities will amplify the vortex pinning due to magnetic impurities, while compensating the concomitant magnetic impurity-induced transition temperature reduction with nonmagnetic impurities. This new technique will lead to a significant enhancement of high field properties of type II superconductors (i.e. increased critical current densities and upper critical fields). This conversion of ordinary superconductors into magnetic superconductors will open a new frontier for superconducting magnet technology. This SBIR project employs optimization of a sintering and manufacturing process for prototype MgB2 wires to guarantee the homogeneous dispersion of impurities along the wire and to achieve the maximal critical current density in a cost efficient way. This project will determine the optimum sintering conditions (i.e., temperature, pressure, and time), utilizing liquid phase sintering of impurities, and will test both in-situ and ex-situ powder-in-tube (PIT) manufacturing processes for producing the highest critical current densities in MgB2 wires. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the possibility of fabricating next-generation cryogen-free 1.5T and 3.0T MRIs, using the resulting MgB2 wires. The low-cost next-generation MRIs will replace the current Nb-Ti-magnet based MRIs, enhancing the public health significantly, because these envisioned MRIs will operate at a higher temperature, 20 K, obviating the need for expensive liquid helium. The elimination of liquid helium cryogen will lead to simple and versatile designs and almost maintenance-free operation, reducing the MRI scan cost up to 40%. The resulting prototype MgB2 wires will be also crucial for next generation of cryogen-free magnets for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), particle accelerators, and fusion reactors. Additionally, it is straightforward to apply this technique to Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn magnet materials. Accordingly, this novel technique has the potential to revolutionize superconducting magnet technology and opens a new research field of converting ordinary superconductors into magnetic superconductors.

A recent new estimate of LD by the CDC places the new number at 476,000 annual cases, up from 329,000 in 2015 which strongly suggests that the number of Americans affected by this vector-borne disease is increasing. Currently, there is no human Lyme Disease vaccine available in the market. A prime-boost vaccination with an intranasal immunogen is a scientific and technologic advance over best vaccination protocols in development for LD that currently rely on parenteral inoculation of a minimum of 3 doses over 1 year. Our preliminary studies show that intranasal administration of a modified OspA vaccine delivered by the laboratory strain WR-PIV5 viral vector (WR-PIV5-OspABPBPk) via prime-boost (2 doses), produces an immune response that is 100% protective against tick transmitted B. burgdorferi infection in mice challenged 4 months after the 1st dose. PIV5 is a safe delivery vector used to develop many vaccines, one of which is undergoing a human clinical trial. The commercialization potential and societal impact of developing a novel, safe and efficacious LD vaccine that can be delivered by a non-invasive method is highly significant given that it may induce more durable immune responses, it could diminish vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine compliance, and it could enable self-administration of one or both doses. The novelty of the vaccine proposed in this Direct to Phase II SBIR application relates to: 1) the use of a modified full length OspA protein in which the putative autoantigenic epitope has been replaced; 2) a needle-free intranasal delivery method in a safe, highly immunogenic viral vector; 3) the reduced number of immunizations; 4) ease of administration; and 5) the potential to increase immunity longevity. We propose to develop a new viral vector expressing OspABPBPk based on the PIV5 vaccine strain (CPI) and evaluate intranasal vaccine efficacy in mice as compared to the WR-PIV5- ABPBPk shown in preliminary results; we will also assess immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of the best vaccine candidate in the non-human primate (NHP) model of Lyme disease; last, we will perform studies required for Investigational New Drug (IND) regulatory approval by FDA. Once the novel vaccine is shown to meet pre-set performance criteria specified in our milestones (rt80% efficacy in mice and non-human primate models), it will be trademarked as LymeMist™ and the company will implement a plan to commercialize it.",MARIA GOMES-SOLECKI,,(917) 741-2470,mgomes.solecki@gmail.com,MARIA GOMESSOLECKI,,(917) 741-2470,mgomes.solecki@gmail.com,,,,"['Disease vaccine', 'vaccine strain', 'clinical trial', 'lyme disease', 'human lyme disease', 'vaccination protocol', 'plan commercialize', 'market', 'vector-borne disease', 'self-administration dose', 'application', 'viral vector', 'development', 'performance', 'safety', 'non-invasive', 'ospabpbpk base', 'non-human primate model', 'immune response', 'needle-free intranasal delivery method', 'viral-vector', 'delivery vector', 'protective tick']"

This effort will combine our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) with new approaches in reactive materials design to develop a new generation of cost-efficient, high strength and highly reactive materials.  The proposed material system will use a blend of elemental or compound powders capable of an energetic (exothermic) chemical reaction.  The existence of different powders will allow for tailoring of the mechanical and reactive properties of the material through engineered variations of the volume fraction of each powder to control the type of reaction and the form of energy release as well as the mechanical properties.  During this program, we will demonstrate the versatility of the approach by fabricating high strength and highly reactive materials that will enhance the munitions lethality by releasing a large amount of exothermal heat and overpressure.  These materials can be used to replace structurally inert materials with structural reactive materials to enhance weapon effectiveness and reduce payload.  Upon successful demonstration, this powder-based process can be easily applied to different powders, and scaled for cost-effective, high-volume production of fully dense structural reactive composites.  BENEFIT:  The proposed program will have dual use commercialization with military as well as commercial applications.  The material can be transitioned into several military hardware programs for weapon development in urban terrain (MOUT) and other low collateral damage scenarios.

This would not happen if every module developer could automatically and independently verify his own component’s compliance prior to delivery, and if the systems integrator could systematically verify a component’s correctness after delivery and prior to acceptance.

The technology is broadly applicable to VOC removal and is highly relevant to environments with low levels of VOCs that pose health, environmental, and manufacturing risks and where current approaches underperform. The proposed innovation addresses key gaps limiting the successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically the need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the implementation of high-performing photoreactors employing robust photocatalysts with long lifetimes. It is expected that the developed technology will extend to chemical processing on an industrial scale, including CO2 conversion. This technology will enable large-scale processes and has the potential for an extensive societal impact by reducing CO2 emissions that affect climate change. The technology will also form the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential products, which will improve indoor air quality in homes and businesses where VOCs pose health risks. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve indoor air quality in industrial settings by developing a photocatalytic technology platform that enables efficient and effective VOC removal. The technology will be particularly valuable in the presence of low-level contamination where alternative technologies are expensive, poorly performing, and adversely affect the environment. Photocatalysts are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants. When activated by light, their surfaces become chemically active via formation of reactive oxygen species, which decompose toxic VOCs. The objectives of this project are to overcome the key drawbacks of commercially available photocatalysts that inhibit their widespread use in industrial environments. Previous photocatalysts form by-products and intermediates, which may be toxic or which can contaminate the photocatalyst. Those products are powder-based, leading to shedding and high attrition. The proposed research will develop a photocatalyst and photoreactor systems that provide efficient light coupling and enable rapid reaction rates.

In addition to the ability of the blood filter remove more toxins than current devices, the silicon nanopore membrane (SNM) blood filter will also confer additional health benefits on ESRD patients because it requires less blood and less overall blood contact time. The ESRD blood filter market is approximately $2 Billion dollars per year. In addition, the SNM technology will also create significant commercial value, have societal impact, and advance science and technology outside the ESRD population. It can be used in a wide array of applications, including water filtration, artificial lungs, and for cell therapies. The proposed project will develop a novel blood filter with SNM to enhance toxin removal during hemodialysis for patients with ESRD. Today, ESRD patients suffer from numerous serious complications due to poor clearance of toxins during hemodialysis. The new SNM-based blood filter will remove toxins more efficiently and significantly improve patient outcomes. The objective of this research project is to demonstrate the feasibility of building a compact blood filter using SNM. SNM are fundamentally different than the polymer membranes currently used in blood filters. Consequently, the SNM must be designed for use in blood filters and tested as blood filters before being used clinically. Developing the next-generation SNM and testing a small-scale SNM blood filter will establish feasibility of the SNM blood filter.

Unfortunately, there are a variety of higher pressure hydrogen needs between 200-700 bar, including heavy-duty vehicle fuel and ammonia production. There is significant investment focused on reducing the cost of green hydrogen production at low pressures, but this will not solve the challenges facing higher pressure hydrogen needs, which are dominated by expensive, energy-intensive, and high maintenance mechanical compressors. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that CSD costs would add $2.70 kg to the cost of 700 bar hydrogen fuel in a mature market (15% FCEV penetration). Hydrogen fuel needs to cost between $3-$4 kg to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels, making CSD costs a critical hurdle to enabling hydrogen fuel cell, zero emission medium and heavy-duty vehicles. If hydrogen fuels can become cost competitive with fossil fuels for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, there is an opportunity to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 435 metric tons of CO2 and fuel imports by $13.65B gallons annually.  To solve the hydrogen compression challenge, there is the opportunity to use electrochemical compression within the electrolysis stack to eliminate or reduce the amount of mechanical compression needed. In the past, this approach has been plagued by mechanical stability and hydrogen crossover challenges. pH Matter has solved the hydrogen crossover challenges with our patented, hybrid liquid alkaline-AEM electrolysis cell, which has 30x less crossover than a state-of-the-art PEM electrolyzer. In this project, we propose to solve the mechanical stability challenges by integrating our electrolysis stack in a Type V, liner free composite cylinder to produce hydrogen 250+ bar with electrochemical compression. We estimate producing hydrogen between 250-800 bar can reduce the cost of 700 bar hydrogen fuel by $0.50-$2.00 kg.  Teams at pH Matter, Infinite Composites, and WHA International will partner together to solve the challenges facing this approach.  A key goal of this project will be to demonstrate hydrogen production at 250+ bar using less than 50 kW-h kg in a carbon fiber vessel capable of 550+ bar pressure. Specific objectives that will be achieved to accomplish the overall goal include: 1. Optimize the PHM electrolysis cell design for operation at 250+ bar, including safety analysis of the design; optimize layer thicknesses and H2-O2 pressure differential 2. Ensure that a cell stack will survive the Infinite Composite manufacturing process, including how to mount the stack, and strategies to survive the curing steps and hydrostatic tests 3. Demonstrate a 5-kW electrolysis stack in a composite carbon fiber tank at 250+ bar metric (550 bar stretch goal) with energy use below 50 kWh kg for hydrogen production  We propose a budget of $500,000 to achieve these development goals over a period of 24 months. This proposal is for a combined phase I phase II grant with a go-no go milestone after task 2 consisting of 3-cell stack performance at 250-bar demonstrates  less than 50 kWh kg after simulated manufacturing process. The project end goal will be a demonstration of a 30-cell, 5-kW electrolyzer, contained in a Type V vessel, that can produce 250 bar+ hydrogen at  less than 50 kWh kg.  PHM is currently developing a 2-kW, 250-bar reversible fuel cell stack for a NASA Tipping Point project. PHM is also developing a 5-kW, 30-bar hydrogen oxygen generation system for a commercial project with Shell (through its subsidiary Power to Hydrogen). Infinite has previously completed grant and development projects focused on Type V vessel design and construction for NSF, NASA, Army, AFWERX, SpaceX, and Blue Origin, among others. Infinite has 40+ high-pressure units operating successfully in the field.

NOx contributes to a variety of environmental problems, including ground-level ozone (smog), acid rain, and visibility impairment.  NOx emissions are generated by motor vehicles, industrial facilities, and electric power plants.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required that stationary sources, such as power plants, implement controls to reduce NOx emissions.  Coal-fired power plants have adopted two basic methods to reduce NOx:  installation of low-NOx burners and use of post-combustion reduction technologies.  Both typically are required to achieve the necessary reduction efficiency.  In the latter process, ammonia is used to convert NOx into harmless nitrogen and water.  However, ammonia itself is a pollutant, so care must be taken not to release excess ammonia¿an event referred to as ¿ammonia slip.¿  To operate at peak efficiency and minimize ammonia slip, plant operators must be able to track the concentration of ammonia in the flue gas.  Despite years of effort, no ammonia monitor has been proven capable of operating reliably in this hot and corrosive flue gas environment.  The objective of this multiphase research project is to develop and demonstrate a completely new approach to ammonia detection.  The central technology of the new monitor is an active-core optical fiber sensor.  The sensor is impregnated with a heat-tolerant, inorganic agent that combines with ammonia to create a complex that can be readily detected by light absorption through the optical fiber.  The compact sensor mounts in-duct, without the need for sample extraction or conditioning.  The basic technology has been successfully tested under laboratory conditions.  The focus of this research project is to extend the sensitivity of the method and demonstrate a suitable level of detection in the presence of flue gas constituents.  ADA Technologies, Inc. (ADA), has built a project team consisting of the sol-gel fiber experts at Diagnostic Instrumentation and Analysis Laboratory (DIAL) and Monitor Labs, a supplier of continuous emission monitors (CEMs) to the utility sector.  During Phase I, this team will demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the basic sensor and test it under realistic flue gas conditions.

Achieving this objective at millimeter-wave frequencies remains particularly challenging.  Linearizer Technology, Inc. (LTI) in conjunction with L-3 Communications Corporation, Electron Devices Division (L-3 EDD) is proposing to develop a TWTA based transmitter including a block up-converter/linearizer (MPM-T) covering the frequency from 43.5 to 45.5 GHz with a linear output power&gt;50 watts and an associated overall efficiency&gt;30%.  This transmitter will have a weight&lt;15 lbs and a volume&lt;0.5 cu. ft. when housed in an air-cooled, weather resistant package suitable for antenna mounting.  Transmitter&quot;s linear performance will be based on supporting Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).  A transmitter goal will be an amplitude modulation/phase modulation ratio (AM/PM) of less than 1.5 degrees /dB from small signal up to saturation across the band.  This work will be based on L3-EDD&quot;s success in producing Q-band microwave power modules (MPMs) and LTI&quot;s experience in producing linearizers for use at Q-band and with QAM at lower bands.    In the first phase LTI designed a linearizer, optimized for operation with EDD&quot;s EHF MPM&quot;s TWT with QAM modulation.  Simulation and testing showed this linearized MPM could achieve an AM/PM of&lt;1  degrees /dB, and with 16QAM a spectral regrowth of&lt;TBD at 2 dB OPBO and an error vector magnitude (EVM) of TBD at 2 dB OPBO.  The L-3 EDD multi-collector miniature EHF TWTA produced for Phase I achieved a DC efficiency of&gt;40%.      BENEFIT:  Modern communications systems use complex modulation schemes, such as QAM, to increase bandwidth utility (efficiency in bit/Hz).  These bandwidth efficient signals have a non-constant envelope with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAR).  Power amplifiers made for these modulations must be highly linear in order to minimize distortion that degrades adjacent channel signals and signal transmission quality (bit error rate).  To achieve the required level of linearity, it is common practice to operate amplifiers at a reduced power level or high output power backoff (OPBO).  The consequences of this approach are a very low efficiency, over-sized and heavy transmitters/amplifiers and power supplies, extra unnecessary heat generation, and higher costs.  At millimeter-wave these factors can make a communication system impractical to implement, particularly for power-consumption-sensitive applications such as SATCOM and avionic/mobile communication platforms.     This project will ultimately provide a compact EHF linear high power transmitter, which currently does not exist.  It will result in greater millimeter-wave power with reduced size, weight, cost and prime power over that available with current technology.  The benefits multiply with the need for linearity.  The greater the linearity required, the greater the return.  The target linearity of the proposed transmitter will improve upon current SATCOM specifications.  Greater than a two to three times increase in effective efficiency over present millimeter-wave power amplifiers is anticipated.    This technology also has value for both space-borne as well as ground-based systems.  The resulting MPM-T will be of great value in all Q-band/EHF communication systems where bandwidth efficiency and power consumption is of concern.  Portable, mobile and airborne communications systems will be prime candidates for integration of this technology.",Therese Ulrich,Marketing Manager,(609) 584-8424,ulrich@lintech.com,Roger Dorval,Vice President of Enginee,(609) 584-8424,dorval@lintech.com,Stub,,,"['power', 'linear performance base support', 'avionic/mobile communication platform', 'effective', 'channel signal', 'avionic communication', 'q-band/ehf', 'ground-based system', 'operation', 'data-rate', 'signal', 'multi-collector miniature ehf twta', 'quadrature amplitude modulation', 'block up-converter/linearizer', 'modern communication system', '/db', 'technology', 'linear output power&gt;50', 'frequency', 'use q-band', 'distortion', 'specification', 'simulation testing linearize', 'qam modulation', 'project', 'linearity', 'amplifier modulation', 'power-consumption-sensitive application', 'q-band', 'over-sized heavy transmitters/amplifier power supply', 'transmission', 'Linearizer Technology', 'of&lt;tbd 2', 'opbo error', 'signal non-constant envelope', 'portable', 'complex modulation scheme', 'millimeter-wave frequency', 'cost', 'level', 'cost prime', 'microwave power module', 'compact ehf linear high power transmitter', 'small signal saturation band', 'qam low band', 'weather', 'communication system', 'millimeter-wave factor communication system', 'phase', 'millimeter-wave power amplifier', 'heat generation', 'mobile airborne communication system', 'space-borne', 'efficiency', 'experience', 'Electron Devices Division', 'consequence approach']"

Anaerobic digestion provides a potentially improved alternative to manufacturing hydrogen from petroleum and natural gas. Anaerobic digesters can produce hydrogen from inexpensive and renewable energy sources such as organic wastes (e.g. food processing waste and animal waste). Recent studies have shown that certain strains of bacteria (e.g. bacteria from the genus Clostridium) are effective at producing hydrogen as a by-product during anaerobic digestion With help from two USDA grants, one of them an SBIR grant in 2005, a new type of high rate anaerobic digester was develop and patented by Hansen Energy and Environmental (HEE) and called the Andigen Induced Blanket Reactor (IBR). Andigen was licensed to sells the patented IBR anaerobic digester. Then again in 2006 with the help from a USDA Rural Development Grant, HEE operated a 1996 Chevy truck on biogas (methane) produced by the IBR digester. A review of literature revealed that if a small percentage (10% to 20%) of hydrogen is added to methane (biogas) it crates a much better fuel and reduces emissions by as much as 50%. Therefore, research into the production of hydrogen was started that resulted in the SBIR phase I award. The technology of the Andigen IBR high rate digester has the ability to control the parameters needed to produce hydrogen on a continuous flow through basis using agricultural waste products, including animal manure and food waste Phase I replicated earlier lab trials for anaerobic production of hydrogen and was able to determine the best method to inhibit the growth of methane producing bacteria in order to create an environment where the hydrogen producing bacteria would thrive. The method used needed to have the potential to work in the Andigen IBR digester. The lab trials have resulted in a patented process that has produced 40% hydrogen. With phase II funding a continuous flow through process for the production of hydrogen will be developed using agricultural waste products that have little or no value. This Phase II project will also show that there is a net energy gain from the same amount of waste by producing both biohydrogen and biomethane. By using biogas as a fuel for his trucks and tractors a farmer can realize a much higher return on his digester investment than the generation of electricity. The production of hydrogen has many commercial applications in a ""hydrogen society"" but the commercial application waiting for the development of this technology is for use as a fuel mixture for the biomethane and biohydrogen produced by the Andigen IBR digesters. This Phase II grant will also include a collaborative effort with Ceramatec of Salt Lake City, Utah to produce a liquid fuel (synthetic Diesel) from hydrogen.

Indeed, nano-scale transducers with capabilities to detect single cells have already been demonstrated. However, the overall sensitivity of a bio-assay is currently limited by diffusion- based mass transport towards the sensor surface (dictated by the fluidic component), and is typically orders of magnitude worse than the transducercapabilities. This bottleneck will always exist in architectures where the volume concentration of a target molecule or cell is detected along a wall of a fluid-filled compartment - as is customary with micro-fluidics or micro-well plat based assays. As such, none of the state-of-the-art, solution- based direct bio-sensing schemes - such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) - can detect less than 103-104 cells/ml. Achieving higher sensitivities require either long incubation periods (hours to days)or lengthy sample amplification. As a result, there is currently no commercial product for rare cell and pathogen detection that can simultaneously achieve a high overall detection sensitivity (i.e., ~10 colony forming units per ml) and a rapid assay completion time (i.e., lt10 mins). This shortcoming directly translates into inefficiencies in patient treatment - such as the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with sepsis and urinary tract infections - that contributes to increased costs, longer hospitalization times and the emergence of drug resistant bacterial and fungal strains. In particular, the need for sensitive and rapid pathogen identification is criticalin the context of sepsis, since each hour lost in targeted treatment results in a 9% increase in patient mortality. Current pathogen identification methods, such as blood cultures or PCR tests, take too long to affect the critical initial decision for treatment selection. Sepsis is the second  largest cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units (750,000+ cases, 215,000+ deaths annually in US alone), costing over 17B/year to treat. Here, we propose to overcome the diffusion bottleneck that plagues all existing fluid-based direct bioassays by developing a novel platform that relies onbiocompatible magnetic nanofluids for rapid, active and selective transport of target moieties to a given sensor&#039;s surface in a label- and labor-free fashion. Our approach can isolate, separate, transport, focus, direct and detect very rare cells or pathogens in an otherwise complex biological fluid sample. Our goal in this Phase I project is to build and demonstrate quantitative, ultra-rapid (lt10 min) detection of several pathogens of interest in spiked buffer, broth and blood samples, with sensitivity levels (~10 pathogens/ml) that cannot be obtained by any existing direct detection method. Furthermore, we propose to study and establish the operational parameters of our prototype system and compare its performance with existing ELISA, PCR and blood culture tests. If successful, our system will achieve unprecedented sensitivity and speed, and could have a real impact in point-of-care diagnostics of infectious agents. Our approach could easily translate into better antibiotic stewardship and lower mortalityrates in sepsis and other severe infections.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial and fungal infections are the root cause of severe sepsis, causing over 215,000 deaths and costing  17 billion dollars to treat each year.

Additionally, the imaging of moving targets will provide a tightly coupledtracking and target ID capability.Phase I clearly demonstrates the capability of this system to detect very slow moving targets (1 meter/sec), while canceling nonmoving targets and ground clutter. During Phase II, ISI will develop a SAMI sensor model to extend the domain of measurableDoppler and quantify the value-added using ISI's MOP/E (Measure of Performance/Effectiveness) tool. The improved tracking performance will lead directly to a target motion compensation procedure capable of focusing a SAR imager on a moving target.

However, despite several decades of substantial efforts, commercialization of cellulosic biofuels has been limited and faces critical challenges, which include increased fossil fuel supply from hydraulic fracturing, poor economical returns from renewable energy/chemical investments, feedstock supply chain logistics, and overall high capital/operating costs due to technological barriers. This SBIR project aims to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of a new biochemical route that utilizes synthetic microbial consortia, consisting of co-cultures of cellulolytic fungi and metabolically engineered bacteria, for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to medium chain methyl ketones (MCMKs). These products are promising as renewable diesel blendstock and have existing markets as high-value specialty chemicals. In Phase I, the focus is to address critical early-stage technical risks, and to establish the basic feasibility of producing these chemicals via engineering and characterization of microbial co-cultures. Commercializing co-culture production of cellulosic MCMKs entails two aspects of development. Specifically, MCMK production will be integrated into a fungal-bacterial co-culture platform and the system will be further engineered towards economically viable performance. In parallel, MCMK fuel properties and specifications for specialty chemical applications will be validated and optimized. Biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass represents a promising alternative to petroleum fuels, however their commercialization still faces significant technical and economic barriers. This project aims to demonstrate the basic feasibility of a new biochemical route, based on microbial co-culture fermentation, for making cellulosic chemicals for diesel fuel and other applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Future Phase II and Phase III research & development will focus on aggressive strain and co-culture optimization to improve performance metrics, scale-up to reach commercial production, and full development of MCMKs for fuel applications. If successful, the proposed project will lead to a new cost- effective technology for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to advanced biofuels, which will generate many technical, economic, social, and environmental benefits to US public and globally. By offering improved profitability and co-revenues for cellulosic bio-refining, successful implementation  of  this  technology  will  help  drive  commercialization  of  new  cellulosic  fuels  and chemicals.  As  a  result,  significant  environmental  benefits  will  be  achieved  through  reducing dependency on fossil fuels/feedstocks and through decrease in green-house gas emissions (GHG).

However, the detection of breast cancer through mammographic screening is complicated by various anatomic factors that can hide or simulate tumors, leading to reduced sensitivity and specificity of mammography.  Consequently, the rate of false negatives is 5%-6%, which results in loss of lives.  The accuracy of mammography can be improved by complementing it with functional imaging techniques such as PET imaging.  This will require dedicated breast imaging PET scanners.  A high-resolution breast imaging PET scanner, consisting of LSO (lutetium silicate) scintillator crystals read out by avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays, is currently under development.  This project will develop a fast, low-noise integrated front-end chip (ASIC) for this scanner, specifically designed to read out the APD signals with high accuracy and low random background.  During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed readout chip was demonstrated by designing, simulating, building, and testing discrete prototypes of the critical parts of the proposed chip (ASIC).  A preliminary design for the core parts of the readout chip was developed.  Phase II will finalize the chip design, create its silicon layout, and fabricate prototype chips.  Using these chips, prototype multi-channel LSO/APD/ASIC detector modules will be designed and built, and their performance will be evaluated for PET applications.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to breast imaging, the proposed chip (ASIC) should be useful for any applications that require reading out APDs or multianode photomultipliertubes with fast and highly accurate timing.

Pim-1 is overexpressed in early prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and metastatic prostate cancer, and its levels predict response to therapy. Pim-1-overexpressing mouse prostate stem cells demonstrate abnormal growth in 3-D collagen cultures, and develop into PIN when placed under the renal capsule. In Rbnull stem cells, Pim-1 overexpression induces frank neoplasia when grown in the renal capsule model. Pim-1 modulates signaling through the mTOR pathway, providing additional opportunities for targeted cancer therapy. Therefore, the goal of this program is to develop unique inhibitors of Pim-1 that will function, with or without a TOR protein kinase inhibitor such as rapamycin, to treat prostate cancer. We have identified a new chemotype that inhibits Pim-1 protein kinase activity both in vitro and in intact cells. In this Phase I STTR project, we will address the feasibility of developing new Pim-1 inhibitors with anticancer activity through the following Specific Aims: 1) To optimize the Pim-1 inhibitors using medicinal and computational chemistry; 2) To evaluate the effects of the new compounds on Pim-1 in vitro and in prostate cancer cells; and 3) To evaluate the anticancer efficacy of Pim-1 inhibitors in vivo. These studies provide an efficient process for the synthesis and evaluation of new inhibitors of an emerging target for prostate cancer chemotherapy. Completion of these Specific Aims will provide a clear demonstration of the feasibility of using Pim-1 inhibitors as anticancer agents, and identify the drug candidate for further development in a Phase II STTR project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Pim protein kinases are critical enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

The approach, based on recent successful tissue engineering efforts, is to seed single cell suspensions derived from immature tooth buds onto biodegradable polymer scaffolds, and to implant the seeded scaffolds in the omentum of rat hosts to support their growth into highly ordered tooth structures. Currently, it is possible to reproducibly bioengineer small tooth crowns containing dentin, enamel and cementum, using tooth bud cells obtained from both rats and pigs. The results are the first to demonstrate the utility of this method to grow tooth structures containing mature dentin and enamel from undifferentiated, cultured tooth bud cells, and suggest the presence of both epithelial and mesenchymal Dental stem cells in the tooth bud cell populations. Currently, the bioengineered tooth structures are quite small and do not acquire the shape of the scaffold onto which the cell suspensions are seeded. The successful clinical application of this method demands an ability to manipulate the size and shape of the bioengineered teeth. Based on preliminary results, and on a desire to generate bioengineered teeth with clinical relevance, the following studies are proposed. The proposed Aims are to: 1) Establish a correlation between cell seeding density and bioengineered tooth size; and 2) Correlate biodegradable scaffold shape with bioengineered tooth shape. Completion of the proposed studies will lead to the generation of bioengineered teeth for eventual use in clinical applications in humans.

The nanoparticles/nanoshells will be deposited and immobilized in a periodic array by nanosphere lithography.This single fiber will transport the exciting laser radiation by the total internal reflection. The evanescent field at the interface (fiber/water) will interact with biological and chemical contaminant molecules adsorbed onto or near the surface of the metal nanoparticles producing the Raman shifted signal coherently amplified by the propagating coherent surface plasmons. These CSERS signals will enter the waveguide and be directed to a spectrometer. The sensor will work as an attached device to a normal Raman identification system developed by Senspex.

Therefore, induction of CYP           enzymes contributes significantly to drug-drug interactions and plays key roles      in the detoxication and bioactivation of xenobiotics. The Food and Drug              Administration request all new drugs be tested for CYP induction, and                pharmaceutical industries are very interested in establishing CYP induction          profiles of drug candidates early so that appropriate decisions can be made for      further development. Studies of molecular signaling have demonstrated that CYP       induction is primarily achieved by receptor-mediated transactivation. The            receptor-mediated action requires interactions with other proteins (e.g.,            co-repressor and co-activator). Some of the interactions exhibit an                  inducer-dependent manner, providing a molecular basis for developing an in           vitro screening system described in this application. In this system, two            plasmids encoding respective receptor and its interactive protein will be            transformed into yeast strains harboring two reporter genes: HIS3 and B              galactosidase. The presence of a CYP inducer will alter the interaction (e.g.,       dissociation or association) between the receptor and its reactive protein,          thus change the expression of the reporter genes. Monitoring of the reporter         activities will reflect the inductive effect of a chemical on CYP enzymes. The       important features of this screening system are:: unlimited availability, high       sensitivity, superior specificity and suitability for high throughput                screening. The proposed studies will focus on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor for      CYPIA and lB, the constitutive androstane receptor for CYP2B, 2C and 3A, the         pregnane X receptor for CYP3A and the peroxisome proliferator-activated              receptor-a for CYP4A. These CYP enzymes collectively involve the metabolism of       more than 80 percent drugs and other xenobiotics.

The platform will determine these deliverables by using ion current data to generate data-driven models of cardiac ion currents. These models will be incorporated into myocyte models that can predict the drug's effect on the cardiac AP. AP data can also be used to validate and refine the models. Finally, the myocyte models will be embedded into a model of electrical wave propagation in the ventricle that can predict a drug's effect on the ECG. This platform could resolve potential discrepancies in data, for example, a drug that exhibits HERG activity but results in little to no QT prolongation. Thus, the simulations will not replace the role of experiments in safety testing; rather, they will help to direct the collection of preclinical and clinical data and to improve the interpretation of these assays. GNS will commercialize this platform through the establishment of alliances with pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations. The structure of these alliances will parallel alliances that GNS has established around a technology platform for oncology drug discovery and development. Phase I of the project focused on developing a software tool for exploring models of the cardiac AP. Phase II aims will focus on improving the power, flexibility, and ease of use of the single cell simulation tools in the platform, and on incorporating algorithms for studying spatially extended models and relating simulation results to cardiac risk assessment. A set of validation experiments will be used to test each step of technology development. By contributing to a better understanding of how compounds affect cardiac electrical activity, this project is relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. This research is relevant to public health because a software platform for simulating computer models of the electrical activity of the heart will help scientists and drug companies to better understand how drugs affect the heart. This improved understanding will help lead to safer and better treatments for patients.",IRENA JOHNSON,,(607) 257-0332,karen@gnsbiotech.com,JEFFREY FOX,,(607) 257-0332,JEFF@GNSBIOTECH.COM,,,,"['tissue-level property', 'power', 'electrical activity', 'drug effect', 'channel', 'effective', 'model', 'activity', 'single cell simulation tool platform', 'software platform', 'computer model', 'applicant', 'algorithm study', 'gene Network Sciences', 'collection', 'safety testing', 'technology platform', 'simulation', 'public health software platform simulate', 'draft guidance', 'electrical wave propagation', 'project', 'cardiac ion current', 'ion current action potential', 'GNS', 'heart', 'problem development', 'data-driven model', 'patient', 'cardiac ap electrocardiogram', 'treatment', 'drug effect ion channel', 'structure alliance', 'level', 'wave propagation ventricle', 'phase project', 'cardiac risk assessment', 'proarrhythmic activity', 'research', 'refine model', 'software tool', 'validation experiment', 'phase', 'clinical datum', 'cardiac ap', 'risk arrhythmia', 'mission']"

This project will specifically aim to provide them with a mechanism for anchoring themselves to an epoxy matrix during curing in such a way that they are able to accept and absorb an applied load.  The successful development of this technology will result in new, light weight, thermoset composites that have extraordinarily high flexural, tensile and impact strengths and can be easily molded into any shape desired.  They will also be useful for reinforcing the weak link in interlaminate composites, the delamination at the interface between the thermoset matrix and reinforcing fibers.  The ability of poly(m-phenylenevinylene-co-2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene (PmPV) to separate large ropes of SWNT into smaller ropes and individual nanotubes by first encasing them, also promotes the solvation of long carbon nanotubes in thermoset resins.  By modifying the side chains attached to the PmPV polymer’s backbone via addition of reactive groups, we will be able to both increase the amount of SWNT uptake in the resins and make the load transfer from the thermoset matrix to the SWNT more effective.BENEFITS: High strength thermoset composite materials made using this technology will have considerable applications in the military because of their unique combination of properties including exceptionally high strength, light weight and stealth capability.

Discourse plays a significant role in creating and perpetuating both a climate of political violence and that violence, itself. Human societies consist of heterogeneous, evolving groups, some of which represent terrorist organizations. Narratives are vital to our understanding of these organizations, their functions, dynamics, and intent.  To promote rapid acquisition of insights into identity and intent of various groups, we propose GAIN (Group Analytics and Intelligence from Narratives) system which automates the processes of: (1) reverse-engineering of discourse structure and semantics; (2) interpretation, inference, and analysis of texts; and (3) reverse-engineering of group identities, sentiments, indicators of moral disengagement, and intent.  GAIN will deliver a novel text-mining, correlation, and reasoning engine, equipped with easy-to-use analytics, to help profile groups of interest and map out their shared mental attributes and likely intent. Ultimately, GAIN will help junior analysts to explore the regional Patterns-of-Life; detect the culture-specific indicators of impending hostility; initiate profiling of hostile actors and groups; and cue their in-depth monitoring with special-purpose ISR assets.    BENEFIT:  GAIN will benefit the U.S. military commanders by facilitating their understanding of individuals, groups, and populations in the region of interest. GAIN will do this by providing superior support to HSCB modeling efforts that enable prediction of behaviors of prospective enemies and noncombatants on and off the battlefield.  GAIN will benefit the organizational research community by providing them with transparent automated ways to collect and analyze HSCB data that can be used to predict (and thus prepare for and/or preempt) hostile behaviors or events that threaten normal functioning of human societies.

Research and development of new treatments is critically dependent on accurate and reliable assessment methods that address multiple cognitive domains. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale or ADAS was among the first comprehensive cognitive/behavioral batteries designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease assessment and is today the most widely accepted and used in research and clinical trials of new antidementia pharmacologic agents.  The project objective is to develop a computerized version of the ADAS that is equivalent to the standard paper-and-pencil version while conferring the advantages of contemporary information technologies.  The primary advantages of computerization include: standardized presentation, immediate electronic data capture, error-free tabulation and scoring; and storage in a powerful, fully relational database. The computer platform to be utilized is uniquely suited to assessment of the elderly and impaired subjects due to its interactive dual-display and control architecture, which integrates a human examiner.  This enables an examiner to score verbal report and overt behavioral performance (e.g. praxis tasks), otherwise not possible with single display systems. The proposed hardware-software ensemble will include not only a computerized ADAS but also a suite of powerful software utilities to assist implementation and management of clinical trials as well as to comply with recently issued regulatory agency guidelines.  In addition to software development, Phase II will implement a longitudinal comparison of the cADAS with the standard ADAS at two established AD research centers.

To date, two of the major deficiencies of geographic studies of cancer are that they lack an appropriate methodology for investigating clusters over the life course and risk factors/covariates are not included in the analysis. These limitations are overcome by this project. Local, global and focused tests for residential histories will be developed based on sets of matrices of nearest neighbor relationships that reflect the changing space-time geometry of the residential addresses of cases and controls. Exposure traces that account for the latency between exposure and disease manifestation, and that use exposure windows of varying duration will be defined. Several of the methods so derived will be applied to evaluate clustering of residential histories in an ongoing case-control study of bladder cancer in south eastern Michigan, and to identify local excesses of breast cancer in Marin County, California. Because humans are mobile, these new methods are a significant advance over approaches that ignore residential histories and instead rely only on place of residence at time of diagnosis or death. The major innovation is the creation of methods for analyzing and modeling the residential histories of cases and controls to identify geographic excesses of cancer risk, both in the study population itself as well as in relation to putative hazards such as point-source releases of carcinogens. Cancer Clustering for Residential Histories Relevance: The techniques and software to be developed in this project will provide a more concise and accurate description of clustering of cancer cases that accounts for risk factors, covariates, residential history, cancer latency, time of diagnosis, and the exposure windows during which causative exposures are hypothesized to have occurred.

Natural beach processes are not stagnant shorelines but rather dynamic systems that shift, migrate, fill and erode. Accurate seafloor depths and nearshore charts are important for forecasting weather, tsunami, and storm surge events that can impact local communities, infrastructure, and shipping industries. The necessity of safe navigation for civilian ships not rated for ice operations and dynamic geographical needs is driving the need for innovative modeling. Traditional mapping techniques are incapable of updating constantly evolving bathymetric navigation models quickly and accurately to suit the needs of business and communities. AI/ML technology has much to offer and investigate in terms of different architectures, applications and possible modifications. Some of the largest roadblocks to implementing current AI/ML modeling are that they require data, cannot directly include current scientific understandings of systems, and are considered a black box for understanding the way the system is solved. The proposed work will teach AI/ML models to learn from more than just data but also scientific theories, and then to write out solutions that can be interpreted by humans This SBIR project will develop a method to integrate data and models in a dynamic learning environment.

In this Fast-Track SBIR project, researchers at Axcend Corporation in collaboration with capillary LC instrumentation experts at Rowan University, two LC column manufacturers, and several leading international pharmaceutical manufacturers, will adapt this compact LC instrument to fulfill the needs in the pharmaceutical industry. In Phase I, the capability of the instrument to meet regulatory guidelines in terms of chromatographic performance and data auditing will be demonstrated. Once completed, Phase II will involve the use of the system in a number of relevant pharmaceutical applications. A high-throughput gradient LC screening method will be developed to identify impurities in new chemical entities. The system will also be coupled to both batch and process manufacturing streams for on-line reaction monitoring in real-time. New capillary LC columns will be developed to enhance the separation of protein-based therapeutics (antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs) and then applied to the full workflow required to characterize these ADCs. All of these aims will be achieved by using the Axcend compact LC system, which is smaller, has a lower cost, is simpler to use, and reduces solvent waste over 1,000-fold over traditional LC methodology.",RAY WEST,,(801) 319-6803,ray.west@axcendcorp.com,MILTON LEE,,(801) 422-2135,milton_lee@byu.edu,,,,"['Fast-Track', 'capability instrument', 'regulatory guideline term', 'high-throughput gradient lc screening method', 'real-time', 'miniaturization field analytical', 'lc methodology', 'system couple', 'market', 'performance', 'project', 'on-line reaction', 'low', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'Axcend compact lc system', 'cost', 'lc model', 'phase', 'chemical entity', 'pharmaceutical application']"

Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), uncoated and anti-reflective coated, has been under evaluation as a “bolt-in” replacement window for the THAAD seeker system to replace the current sapphire window. The resulting data from the Phase I development efforts has shown that Zinc sulfide presents a wideband capability, has the structural properties, demonstrates superior optical properties, and will result in a significant system cost reduction of 70%-80% for the seeker window.  The optical transmission capabilities of the current sapphire window exhibit a limited waveband. A seeker window which has the ability to transmit at a wider waveband will be beneficial for target acquisition and target discrimination.  The selection of ZnS as an alternate seeker window material commenced with a rigorous computational fluid dynamics effort to predict the worst case aerodynamic heating combined with finite element thermal and structural analysis used to construct a statistical analysis model. The thermophysical property testing and optical property testing conducted under two (2) independent MDA Phase I Sbir efforts has validated this analysis. It was shown that ZnS provides the thermostructural properties and optical properties for uncoated material and anti-reflective coated material.  To prepare ZnS for system consideration, flight test, and Block Upgrade, thermostructural evaluation under worst case flight conditions and high fidelity over-testing of the worst case thermal conditions will be conducted to validate the selection of zinc sulfide.  Commercially available multispectral zinc sulfide, which contains an anti-reflective coating, will be fabricated and tested in the AEDC/WO Hypersonic Wind Tunnel to validate its thermostructural capabilities. A total of 10 test runs will be conducted consisting of three (3) calibration runs followed by the testing of seven (7) ZnS windows in order to obtain statistical data.

Information-theoretic investigation on simulcasting is currently an active research area. Practical implementation of simulcasting in current and future generation wireless networks is in still its infancy. The goal of this project is to develop practical physical-layer signaling techniques and higher-layer protocols that support simulcasting. In Phase I, computer simulations will be used to investigate the performance of these algorithms and protocols under common channel models. In Phase II, the algorithms and protocols developed in Phase I will be prototyped on a software-defined radio (SDR) platform.  Channel spectrum is a precious commodity. The recent advances in cellular and wireless local area network (WLAN) technology make this especially true in the cellular and ISM bands. So techniques to use channel spectrum more efficiently are rapidly adopted once they have been proven.

Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%. Multiple attempts result in pain and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76. Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications. One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3 billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year. These failure rates occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve first time IV access. In phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access, and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming intra lumen placement. The system needs to be cost effective, durable and acceptable to a multitude of diverse clinicians. The disposable adapter probe will connect to a hand piece that will tactilely enable the clinician to actuate rotation and advancement of the optical probe to acquire data necessary to create clinically relevant 3D real time images. The data are transmitted to a control unit for processing and then presented to a small form display such as smart phone. Research activity will be focused in developing the egonomically acceptable hand piece that does not interfere with variable angular approaches to the vein. A critical part of the ongoing research will focus on software design for creating an optimal graphic user interface (GUI).

Over 50 million patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or late stage type 2 diabetes (T2D) worldwide require life-long insulin injections. By current standards of care, andgt;50% of the patients fail to meet glucose control goals, leading to vascular complications and premature death. This is largely due to the narrow therapeutic window of insulin and its potential to cause life-threatening hypoglycemia. Novel therapies that replace native pancreatic b cell function, namely, releasing insulin in a glucose-regulated manner, remain a tremendous unmet need. Forkhead Bio’s co-founder Dr. Domenico Accili discovered that genetic ablation of the transcription factor Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) in gut endocrine cells reprograms them into “b-like” cells that secrete insulin in response to glucose. Accili et al. also uncovered several series of small-molecule FOXO1 inhibitors. This body of work delineates a path towards developing an oral FOXO1 inhibitor therapy that converts specific gut cells to replace b cell function. The product of this SBIR will be an oral pill that normalizes glucose control and eliminates the burden of insulin injections and frequent blood glucose checks, thus improving patients’ quality of life, reducing medical costs, and making “insulin-dependent” diabetes a disease of the past. In Phase I, we validated the target pharmacologically, showing that small-molecule FOXO1 inhibitors induce gut b-like cells in mice. In addition, we synthesized andgt;350 novel molecules, established structure-activity relationships, and identified compounds suitable for oral dosing. We also created ex vivo assays critical for assessing clinical translatability, showed evidence for non-human primate (NHP) as an appropriate large animal efficacy model and identified collaborators at the Oregon National Primate Research Center with strong expertise in this area. The significant Phase I results proved the feasibility of our SBIR goal to develop an oral agent that converts b- like cells in the gut to normalize glucose control in both T1D and T2D. In Phase II, we aim to (1) complete lead optimization to identify Lead Candidate molecules with sufficient activity, selectivity, drug-like properties, and tolerability; (2) demonstrate the Lead Candidates’ efficacy in diabetic mouse models; and (3) select one Lead Candidate to demonstrate in vivo gut b-like cell conversion in NHPs. If awarded, this Phase II will accelerate chemistry optimization and enable the demonstration of large-animal translatability for a novel target. Following Phase II, we will perform additional IND-enabling studies and submit an application to the FDA to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials. We have secured intellectual properties including composition of matter claims. Our lead product, likely to be licensed or acquired in preclinical or early clinical stage by a major pharmaceutical company, will be an oral pill that normalizes glucose control and improves quality of life for over 50 million patients with diabetes, with the potential to displace andgt;$30 billion annual sales of insulins.PROJECT NARRATIVE Over 50 million patients worldwide with type 1 diabetes or late-stage type 2 diabetes require life-long insulin therapy, which carries a tremendous personal health burden and staggering economic costs. In this SBIR project, Forkhead BioTherapeutics seeks to develop an oral small-molecule FOXO1 inhibitor therapy that coverts endogenous gut endocrine cells into b-like cells that respond to glucose and secrete insulin.

The most advanced of these tools use a repathing engine to determine the most vulnerable access points, the attacker’s probable path and the most advantageous response by the security forces. This repathing engine then adjusts the attackers’ and responders’ actions as the events occur. One issue with the current state of the art is that the modeling and simulation does not account for changes in plant status during a security event. These changes could impact the effectiveness of the response and incorporation of these changes will alter the proposed response during the event to improve overall response during the event. A physical security modeling and simulation tool that utilizes a repathing engine to automate dynamic path finding for planning and combat modeling will be reviewed to determine the feasibility of extending the tool to include changes in plant conditions, such as the thermal status of the plant or changes to controls that could impact margin to failure. Negative outcomes can be reduced by including the responses needed to prevent damage to the physical plant. A dynamic repathing engine can ensure that the response most likely to ensure a successful response to an event is selected. The feasibility of incorporating a plant condition modeling and simulation tool from a national laboratory that models and simulates the physical plant of a nuclear facility through dynamic probabilistic risk assessment will be reviewed to determine the most efficient means of integration with the physical security tool. This will allow the physical security tool to evaluate outcomes and response plans that incorporates plant changes to determine most the effective response to the event from plant status as well as a security perspective. In phase 1 discussions will be held with a national laboratory and industry experts to determine data requirements for the integration of the two modeling and simulation tools, as well as the best method of presenting the results of the integrated simulation to the user for optimum response planning. Based on this a design will be developed for the Phase II prototype. By extending the modeling and simulation of a physical security modeling and simulation tool to include changes in plant status a plant operator could improve the response effectiveness to security events at their facilities. This feature will most likely be incorporated as a module of the existing physical security commercial product for distribution. This would allow plant operators to determine if integrated plant condition and security modeling and simulation are required for their installation, or if individual tools that perform these tasks are best suited to their facility. The new software module for the commercial product will allow plant operators the ability to improve their response plans via this integrated modeling and simulation approach.",Blane Schertz,,(256) 527-4469,bschertz@aressecuritycorp.com,John Halsema,,(703) 628-0926,jhalsema@aressecuritycorp.com,,,,"['modeling simulation', 'effective', 'thermal status', 'integrated modeling simulation', 'base geospatial model', 'outcome response plan', 'physical security', 'attack', 'plant status', 'modeling review', 'dynamic repathing', 'response event', 'physical security tool', 'software module', 'simulation', 'response', 'dynamic', 'modeling', 'damage', 'base design', 'effectiveness', 'margin failure', 'security', 'integration', 'current', 'plant operator ability', 'security force', 'security event', 'incorporation change', 'overall response event', 'distribution', 'action event', 'simulation tool', 'plant change', 'response plan', 'physical security modeling', 'phase', 'plant operator', 'response attack', 'module', 'physical plant', 'plant condition']"

The organism's autotrophic production of nutrients from sunlight and extreme halotolerance will allow new biomanufacturing processes to overcome the limitations on scaling of bioreactor size inherent to conventional recombinant cell culture systems. By enabling production of therapeutic recombinant proteins on an ultra-large scale, the platform will solve critical problems that confront current biomanufacturing techniques, such as the prohibitively high capital costs for new facilities and the difficulty of rapidly expanding production to satisfy unexpected demand. Our approach will particularly benefit manufacturing of health products required in high quantities, including many monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic proteins such as human serum albumin, industrial biopharmaceutical enzymes such as trypsin, and products needed to respond rapidly to emerging highly infectious diseases or bioterror threats. The objectives of the overall project (Phases I and II) are to transform strains of D. salina to express a commercially useful biopharmaceutical protein, create a modular vector system to facilitate rapid development of strains expressing other recombinant proteins, optimize expression levels to create ""protein factories"", and demonstrate initial scale-up and ease of product purification. These results will serve as the basis for a commercial production process to be licensed to biopharmaceutical companies. Phase I will establish feasibility by demonstrating transformation of D. salina and verifying stable incorporation of a foreign gene into the organism's nuclear chromosomal DNA for the first time. Phase I objectives include vector construction, development of techniques to prepare the cells by permeabilizing their glycoprotein sheath, transformation by electroporation, and verification by RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses. Relevance: Many new protein drugs treating a wide range of serious diseases and conditions (including many cancers, acute blood loss, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) are now available or under development.

Laboratory studies have shown that it may be possible to produce functional replacements for diseased or in jured tissues. However, there are still a number of scientific hurdles that must be overcome if such therapies are going to be realized. The first and most intensively studied aspect of stem cell biology are the mechanisms by which stem cells are transform ed into cells with distinct physiological functions. This area of stem cell research will not be addressed in this proposal. Instead, the second area of investigation, namely how to produce enough cells from a given number of stem cells to be of practical  use in creating tissues for regenerative medicine. It is assumed by many investigators, that a virtually unlimited number of stem cells can be produced in simple culture systems to meet all therapeutic requirements. This belief is based on observations of  the ability of stem cells to self-renew in culture. The conventional cell culture environment does not resemble the in vivo environment in which the stem cells normally exist and therein lies the problem for large scale growth of stem cells. In vivo, stem  cells are maintained in largely quiescent state. Most cell divisions lead to the production of a stem cell and a daughter cell which will continue to divide to eventually produce a tissue. The numbers of stem cells actually change very little. This situati on is thought to have evolved to minimize the possibility of mutations which could lead to uncontrolled growth, ie. cancer. In this proposal, we intend to utilize the NASA-designed Rotary Cell Culture System to mimic the normal in vivo environment of stem  cells so that the product of the culture is daughter cell or committed progenitor which can be harvested and stimulated to grow into a tissue which can be utilized therapeutically. The RCCS is ideally suited to reproduce the 3-dimensional microenvironment  that exists in the human body. By co-culturing supporting cells with stem cells on a polymer scaffolding material, we will create a culture system which will allow the long term maintenance of stem cells while promoting the production of progenitor cells w hich can be continuously harvested in a controlled manner for use in tissue engineering applications.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at producing a stem cell culture system which can maintain adult stem cells in a specialized environment t o maintain them for long periods of time and stimulate the production of large numbers of progenitor cells for regenerative medicine.

PRESAGE uses this learned knowledge to detect emerging threats from changing sentiment extracted from newly acquired information. This provides the situational analysis that enables troops to take a proactive stance and conduct operations when, where, and how they will be most effective. In the PRESAGE Phase I effort, 21CT demonstrated the effectiveness of a neural network based approach to threat risk estimation. The results are significant for the future development of PRESAGE technology. We have proven the concept that recurrent neural architectures can be used to estimate information analogous to threat levels from sentiment and theme features extracted from unstructured data.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the stand ard therapy but they are expensive the total cost of an ICD implant approaches  50,000 and the United States spends more than  2.2B on these implants annually. ICDs are effective, but not curative up to half of the patients who receive ICDs develop new sit es of VT that are unresponsive to the defibrillator, requiring them to be put on antiarrhythmia drugs at additional cost. And 55,000 ICDs have been recalled in the last few years for design and reliability problems. Thermal ablation therapy is an attractiv e alternative or adjunctive therapy to ICD implantation as it has a success rate of more than 90% for many classes of supraventricular tachycardias, but it has not been successful in treating ischemic VT. It is generally agreed that ablation therapy has be en unsuccessful because it is not capable of treating the large, deep arrhythmogenic foci that cause ischemic VT. We have developed a method capable of doing so using saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation. We treat VT by injecting warm saline into  the tissue simultaneous with RF ablation. The infused saline flows through the extracellular space convecting energy. This increases the effective thermal conductivity of the tissue by a factor of more than 20. We have used our steerable SERF ablation cat heter with a retractable electrode to demonstrate in a canine infarct model that SERF ablation creates thermal lesions large enough to treat VT the lesions are reliably transmural, even in the presence of infarct scars, and multiple lesions can be placed t o provide a line of block. We have also shown that the therapy is safe, that the catheter meets safety and reliability requirements, and that it is biocompatible. We propose to complete the development of our saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation  system for treating ischemic VT. We will complete the design of our system and catheter and validate that they comply with medical safety standards (EN60601-1), biocompatibility (ISO-10993), and validate the sterilization to a sterility assurance level (SA L) of 10-6. We will carry out extensive preclinical survival testing in large-animal infarct models at the Mayo Clinic, Loyola University, The University of Pennsylvania, and the Brigham and Women's Hospital. We will then apply for and obtain an Investigat ional Device Exemption (IDE) to carry out a multi-center clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our development of SERF ablation to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) is relevant to public health in that we are addressing a growing and expensive problem t he implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) that patients receive to treat these potentially fatal arrhythmias are neither curative nor reliable. The United States spends over  2B annually placing ICDs, and half of the patients develop additional VTs  that are unresponsive to their ICD. At minimum the shocks these patients receive severely reduce their quality of life. At worst the patient remains susceptible to sudden cardiac death. An effective and inexpensive method of treating these patients VTs is  urgently needed.",PATRICK HAMILTON,,(617) 623-3157,PAT@EPLIMITED.COM,MICHAEL CURLEY,,(617) 623-3157,MIKE@EPLIMITED.COM,,,,"['tissue', 'effective', 'steerable serf ablation', 'saline-enhanced radiofrequency ( serf ) ablation', 'thermal ablation therapy', 'medical safety standard', 'applicant', 'rf ablation', 'saline-enhanced radiofrequency ( serf ) ablation   system', 'line block', 'adjunctive therapy', 'saline flow', 'development', 'implant', 'safety', 'iso-10993', 'infarct model', 'ard therapy', 'ICD', 'life', 'multi-center clinical trial', 'SA', 'patient', 'implantation success', 'quality', 'large-animal infarct model Mayo Clinic', 'cost', 'problem', 'icd', 'serf ablation', 'implant approach', 'preclinical survival testing', 'therapy', 'public health', 'extracellular space convect energy', 'method', 'ablation therapy', 'Investigat ional device exemption', 'ide', 'arrhythmia']"

Currently, the primary method (&gt; 95%) employed for hydrogen production commercially is steam-methane reforming (SMR). While, this process can produce hydrogen at a cost of &lt; $2.0 / kg H2 it has a high carbon intensity. On the other hand, while electrolysis is an environmentally friendly alternative for hydrogen production, the cost of hydrogen generation using electrolysis is typically &gt; $4.0 / kg H2.We propose the development of Atmospheric Microwave Plasma (AMP) for the pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon black as a value-added byproduct. The electricity required in the AMP process is &#188; that of the electricity required for electrolysis. In addition, the solid carbon produced by the AMP can be used a valuable byproduct.MAAT Energy has been developing microwave-based plasmas for chemical applications. We will leverage that expertise in order to apply our experience to gain operational advantages of the AMP process. In Phase I we developed novel reactors and means of conveying and separating the carbon solids, as well as catalytic means to adjust the plasma temperature. We have developed and are presently testing a configuration that eliminates the need of dielectrics in close proximity to the plasma to improve reliability of the system.

Cancers develop and spread within the body when tumor cells are not detected or destroyed by the immune system. Although certain new therapies hold promise, current cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, tend to kill cells non-selectively and can cause harm to the patient. It is, therefore, critical to develop immunotherapeutic approaches that will enable the patient's immune system to recognize the cancer cells and eliminate them. The advantage of immunotherapy over the existing treatment approaches is that immune response to tumors is specific, safe, and has a memory component that can safeguard the body against newly arising tumors. T-cell response directed at tumor antigens is critical to the prevention and elimination of cancer cells. T cells require three distinct signals for activation; Signal 1 is antigen specific and mediated by the T-cell receptor interaction with the antigen, Signal 2 is mediated by receptor and ligand interactions, such as CD40/CD40L and CD28/B7, and Signal 3 is mediated by cytokines. Lack of signal 2 or co-stimulation is a critical mechanism used by many tumors for the evasion of the immune system. In this application, we propose to use a proprietary technology called ProtExTM   to place a novel costimulatory protein, SA-hCD40L, on the surface of ovarian tumor cells in less than 2 hours. When present on the tumor cell surface, the protein is expected to activate key cells of the patient's immune system to mount an anti-tumor response. This may result in physical elimination of tumor cells, even at distant sites in the body. During this project we will display SA-hCD40L on the surface of human tumor cells of ovarian origin and test whether these cells can generate anti-tumor immune responses in peripheral blood lymphocytes harvested from healthy individuals and ovarian cancer patients. In vitro proof-of-concept for this approach will allow us to test the efficacy of this approach for cancer immunotherapy in the clinic. In the longer term, we will develop and market an anti-tumor vaccine containing SA-hCD40L. Use of the vaccine will lower the death rate and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. The long-term success of this project will lead to more effective treatment of cancer in a way that preserves the patient's overall health",ROLF HUSEBY,,(502) 212-2493,RHUSEBY@APOIMMUNE.COM,HAVAL SHIRWAN,,(502) 852-2066,HAVAL.SHIRWAN@LOUISVILLE.EDU,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,,,"['radiation therapy', 'tumor', 'anti-tumor response', 'immune system', 'signal 2', 'applicant', 'tumor evasion', 'non-selectively', 'immunotherapeutic approach', 'signal', 'cancer cell', 'long-term', 'life cancer', 'cancer', 'ovarian origin test', 'market', 't-cell response', 'harm patient', 'cancer immunotherapy clinic', 'ovarian cancer', 'sa-hcd40l', 'chemotherapy', 'project', 'signal activation', 'tumor cell surface', 'physical elimination', 'immunotherapy', 'anti-tumor', 'test efficacy', 'signal 1 antigen', 'anti-tumor vaccine', 'patient', 'detect', 'distant site body', 'treatment', 'quality', 'immune response', 'body newly', 'therapy', 'proof-of-concept approach', 'proprietary technology', 'surface ovarian tumor cell 2 hour', 'long term', 'co-stimulation', 'spread body tumor cell', 'peripheral blood lymphocyte', 'treatment cancer', 'memory component']"

Combined use of the underutilized feedstocks such as coal fines and biomass, in modular gasification-based processes integrated with hydrogen production and carbon capture, will enable a net-zero or net-negative carbon footprint. However, such modular gasification processes will require the hydrogen separation processes to operate with high efficiency and at lower operating pressures than are typically used in traditional steam methane reforming processes. General statement of how this problem is being addressed. TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop a highly efficient modular hydrogen separation process that can efficiently separate the carbon from the hydrogen in the synthesis gas generated by the gasification of coal fines and biomass to produce “green” hydrogen that has negative carbon emissions. TDA’s proposed process uses next generation adsorbents to remove carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (which can be sent for storage or utilization) to produce the high purity hydrogen in a modular pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process. What is to be done in Phase I? Our specific Phase I objectives are to complete the laboratory scale proof-of-concept demonstration of the modular hydrogen separation process and complete a detailed process design and techno-economic feasibility and life cycle analysis to show the merits of the proposed technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits There is a large commercial market for the hydrogen PSA processes, and the CO2 and CO sorbents developed here for use in “green” hydrogen production with negative carbon foot print from coal waste/biomass gasification and steam methane reforming plants will find both immediate use in today’s hydrogen plants and in tomorrow’s far more environmentally friendly waste and biomass powered “green” plants.",John Wright,,(303) 940-2300,jdwright@tda.com,Ambalavanan Jayaraman,,(303) 940-5391,ajayaraman@tda.com,,,,"['net-negative carbon footprint', 'hydrogen separation process', 'storage', 'carbon dioxide', 'modular hydrogen separation', 'net-zero carbon economy', 'market', 'green ” hydrogen negative carbon', 'powered', 'hydrogen production', 'feedstock coal', 'technology', 'operating pressure', 'hydrogen modular pressure swing adsorption', 'print coal', 'gasification-based process', 'techno-economic feasibility life cycle analysis', 'hydrogen psa process', 'statement', 'capture', 'emission', 'green ” hydrogen production', 'modular gasification process', 'gasification coal', 'Research', 'carbon foot', 'coal', 'gas', 'general statement', 'phase', 'carbonaceous feed stock', 'reforming process', 'efficiency']"

Caffeine is widely used to enhance athletic performance, body composition, pain relief, and mental acuity. Naturally caffeinated beverages include coffee, black and green tea, cola, cocoa, guarana, yerba mat&eacute;, and Yaupon tea. According to the Tea Association of the USA, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world next to water. Tea can be found in 80 percent of American households. Of the caffeine sources listed above, the wild yaupon growing in the American southeast is the only significant native source of caffeine in the continental US. Yaupon tea was a significant part of Native American and early American culture and is undergoing resurgence in popularity in both the U.S. and E.U. with raw material for processing coming from wild collected sources. Yaupon Holly is widely cultivated for its ornamental value however, there are no known Yaupon Holly plantations established for production as a food. The Yaupon Wellness Company (YWC), is a rural Georgia based company founded in 2013, that wild-picks, dries, roasts, brews, and distributes certified organic bottled Yaupon tea and dry ASI tea products. YWC is currently harvesting approximately 500 pounds of wild Georgia Yaupon leaves per month. The company has developed distribution channels and has launched the bottling of its Yaupon Tea for the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) market.The current barrier facing YWC&#39;s commercial viability is the need for a reliable, sustainable source of yaupon holly. Cultivation of Yaupon for food purposes offers a new crop opportunity for quality minded small and mid-sized farms therefore the PI has established the YWC Pilot Farm in order to begin development of optimal production practices and serve as a model for other growers to replicate. This project proposes to utilize this initial planting to evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of cultivating Yaupon Holly for it food value. Specifically the project will: 1) Characterize clonal plantings of Yaupon on the YWC Pilot Farm from chemical and agronomic perspective. 2)Compile plantation establishment and production costs together with yields through one production cycle of the pilot plantation. 3)Utilize the above data to develop a preliminary enterprise budget for Yaupon production based on actual establishment and production costs. 4) Begin development of an outreach plan for recruiting and training potential growers.Successful achievement of these objectives will result in the development of a baseline dataset of Yaupon properties that will be used to evaluate the effects of treatments and make a preliminary determination of financial feasibility. In addition, an outreach plan focused on small farmers will be developed with the assistance of extension and small farm specialists. Assuming a successful outcome to Phase I, Phase II will expand production research and optimize the production system through at least two additional cycles. Phase II will also evaluate the feasibility of an on-farm processing facility and fully develop outreach and training programs including a plan for mentoring new growers through their first production cycle. Phase III will commercialize the research by partnering with existing small farm outreach efforts to present the plan to growers with the goal of establishing 100 acres of Yaupon food production during the first three years.Benefits from a successful project include enhanced profitability and farm diversity for growers, a higher quality, more reliable source of Yaupon raw material for processors, enhanced consumer safety and satisfaction, and positive environmental effects through a reduction in the need to wild collect Yaupon to meet increasing market demand.",Lou Thomann,Founder,(912) 596-1506,Louthomann@drinkasi.com,Lou Thomann,,(912) 596-1506,louthomann@drinkasi.com,,,,"['production food', 'model', 'plan', 'Holly food value', 'production system', 'production practice', 'outcome phase', 'market', 'effect', 'mental acuity', 'production', 'training', 'development', 'project', 'profitability', 'environmental effect', 'processor', 'Tea ready-to-drink', 'property', 'food production', 'grower production cycle', 'material processing', 'ornamental value', 'treatment', 'high quality', 'quality', 'body composition', 'technical financial feasibility', 'cost', 'distribution', 'processing facility', 'research', 'dataset', 'athletic performance', 'food purpose', 'training program', 'diversity', 'consumer safety satisfaction', 'phase']"

It replaces the traditional Michelson design with an auto-correlator adapted with a novel polarization switching probe. The objectives of Phase I will be achieved through the following two specific aims. Aim 1 is the development and fabrication of a prototype PS-OCT system embodying the proposed design approach. Aim 2 is to demonstrate through in-vitro imaging with extracted human teeth that the prototype system has the requisite performance for monitoring the progression of tooth decay. A successful Phase I will lead to a Phase II effort which will focus on the design and development of a PS-OCT instrument and hand held probe suitable for in-vivo clinical evaluations. The Phase II objectives are: 1) The design provide high resolution imaging of incipient caries; 2) It can be transitioned to a manufacturing process meeting the cost objectives of market-wide acceptance in the dental field; and 3) The design is suitable to our already selected Phase III partner. Other commercial applications include medical imaging of oral cancer and pre-cancers, bi-refringent tissues and non-destructive evaluation of materials, laminations and composite structures.", ,,(818) 782-0997,,IRA BUSH,,(818) 782-0997,JBUSH@OPTIPHASE.COM,,,,"['applicant', 'bi-refringent tissue', 'lamination', 'fabrication', 'structure', 'human tooth', 'tooth decay', 'polarization switching probe', 'development', 'performance', 'dental carie', 'clinical evaluation', 'market-wide', 'medical imaging', 'phase lead phase', 'dental field', 'polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography', 'detect', 'in-vivo', 'oral cancer', 'dietary change', 'design', 'detection', 'Michelson design', 'cost', 'polarization', 'non-destructive evaluation material', 'monitoring', 'research', 'anti-bacterial therapy', 'manufacturing process', 'imaging extract', 'manufacture', 'high resolution imaging', 'diagnosis', 'clinical', 'low intensity laser', 'phase', 'non-surgical mean fluoride therapy', 'in-vitro', 'phase proposal']"

But, the proliferation of sensor systems has created a large volume of multi-sensor data across a number of physical spectra. These resulting measurements can be so disparate that traditional aggregation methods perform poorly given heuristics/assumptions required to map them into conventional algorithms.  The team of 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) and the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS &amp; T) propose to develop an innovative multiphysics-based sensor fusion approach, called Voxel Fusion (VOXION).  Applicable for improving target detection and discrimination in the ISR domain, VOXION maps the disparate sensor fields from a suite of EO/IR, RF and acoustic sensors into a single common multiphysics-based representation.  Estimates on target parameters are then obtained directly from the unified physics field improving system accuracy, decreasing uncertainty, and achieving improved inferences more resilient to changes in the targets and environmental conditions as compared to classical fusion approaches. The innovative voxel-based concept; our diverse, well-qualified team; combined with 21CSi&quot;s superlative, sustained record in SBIR/STTR commercialization; makes our team the right choice to improve multiphysics-based sensor fusion for the warfighter.  BENEFIT:  The VOXION multiphysics-based sensor fusion algorithm will be able to map the disparate sensor fields into a single common multiphysics representation that is needed to improve target detection and discrimination in the ISR domain.   VOXION would generate estimates of target parameters from a unified physics representation of objects, improving system accuracy, decreasing uncertainty, and achieving improved inferences more robust to changes in the targets and environmental conditions.  Thus, VOXION will markedly improve the fusion of data from disparate sensor types in order to improve situational awareness and sensor hand-offs. The VOXION technology has the potential of maturing into a cohesive multi-sensor fusion tool to assist in the traditionally manual processes of unlike sensor aggregation. This will not only improve the accuracy of the resulting situational awareness picture, but also allow for faster situation recognition and more rapid actionable intelligence.

Ethanol is produced primarily by fermentation of grains; however, a few industrial processes manufacture high purity ethanol from the hydration of ethylene.  If synthetic ethanol instead could be made directly from the oxidation of light alkanes, which are found in abundance in the petroleum industry, these low-value fuel gases could be converted into a high value alcohol.  Previous work has led to the identification of a novel catalyst formulation for light alkane oxidation, leading to the production of valuable oxygenates such as alcohols.  Because the process directly oxidizes light alkanes instead of olefins, it could operate more cheaply than current industrial synthetic alcohol manufacturing processes.  Phase I will synthesize and test new catalysts to determine the combination of catalyst formulation and operating conditions that provide the best selectivity to alcohols.  In Phase II, the catalyst formulation will be further optimized, and the best catalyst will be tested in a bench-scale reactor. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Since the alkane feed stocks proposed for oxidation to ethanol are cheaper than traditional synthetic raw materials, high purity synthetic ethanol should become cheaper to manufacture.  As a result, the development of an alternate route to ethanol from a cheap, abundant (domestic supply) fossil fuel feedstock such as ethane should help alleviate some of the demand for corn-fermentation ethanol.

However, the use of IVIAT is limited to analysis of diseases where the pathogen infects a host that is capable of mounting an antibody response. In this application, we describe a modification of IVIAT called Change Mediated Antigen Technology (CMAT) that allows identification of both pathogen and host genes specifically expressed during infection. Proof of principle has been accomplished using Xanthomonas campestris infection of bean plants. In general, CMAT is potentially capable of identifying any gene that is expressed by any cell when it undergoes any sort of change. We intend to expand the application of CMAT to use it as a tool to study genes that are specifically expressed during oncogenesis in colorectal cancer. Genes that are discovered will potentially serve as excellent biomarkers for studying the efficacy of therapy of this disease and provide novel targets for new diagnostic and vaccine strategies. There are 3 Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, phage display libraries of human genomic DNA and cDNA from colorectal cancer tissue samples of subjects will be constructed in bacteriophage T7. Sufficient independent clones will be obtained to assure complete coverage of these libraries. In Specific Aim 2, a CMAT IgY probe will be created by immunizing chickens with colorectal cancer tissue samples from subjects. Antibodies produced in response to the immunogens will be purified from eggs and adsorbed with lysates made from healthy tissue of the same subjects. In Specific Aim 3, the CMAT IgY probe will be used to biopan the T7 libraries to enrich for clones expressing proteins made by colorectal cancer cells that are not made by healthy cells. A verification step employing Western blotting will be used to eliminate false positives. The cloned inserts in verified clones will be sequenced and the results subjected to genomic and proteomic analyses to generate a list of genes and their proteins that are expressed by transformed cells during different stages of colorectal cancer and not by healthy cells. This list will provide the starting material for the Phase II work, which will entail screening of the expressed proteins for their potential to serve as biomarkers in diagnosis of colorectal cancer and as possible targets for early diagnosis and vaccine strategies. Change Mediated Antigen Technology (CMAT) is a new method for identifying genes that are expressed when a cell undergoes a change.

Critical challenges include sensing/geo-locating LPI Threat emitters, communicating their locations to the standoff jammer in real-time while using extremely high sensitivity, lightweight and low power sensor, and communication systems technology. Further, the system concept must be consistent with the Air Force Layered Sensing Architecture and provide a network-centric solution for delivery of data from the sensor platform to all appropriate layers within the architecture.

The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered for students working with any text. The broader impact of this Phase I project will be to improve how students read, and therefore how they learn. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. Difficulty reading extends to all subjects; poor readers have only a 14% chance of success in math and 1% chance of success in science. Reading is the heart of education. It is the most important skill we learn in school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Thirty million students in the U.S. struggle to read, so reducing that number by even 10 or 20 percent would mean a huge improvement in the educational and financial opportunities for millions of Americans. Globally the problem is even larger, and digital devices give us the opportunity to reach over a billion people worldwide.

This technology has been applied to through-clothing measurement of ECG, with successful preliminary measurements for EEG and ERP. Analysis has already shown that the normal E-field, En, produced by brain sources is more tightly focused in space than the tangential field from the same source when measured through the head. The goal of Phase I is to quantify how a measurement of the E-field in the direction normal to the scalp can be applied to replace or augment conventional electric potential data collected on the scalp surface. 3 specific analysis issues of relevance for EEG, ERP brain source imaging will be investigated. Synthetic data, including sensor effects, will be generated by a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation supported by analytic calculations. The benefit of measuring the E-field will be quantified by analyzing the data with and without the normal field information, using a modified form of the Brainstorm program. In Phase II, a new type of EEG electrode system that includes sensors of the normal electric field will be constructed together with algorithms that utilize the En information. The system will be directly compared with a 120- electrode Geodesic Sensor Net System on subjects participating in standard evoked potential and EEG experiments. The ability to measure the normal E-field external to the head provides an entirely separate new channel of information about the electrical sources in the brain. If successful this program will contribute to the whole art of EEG signal acquisition, providing a general advance in research and clinical measurement technology.

In addition to propulsion and active flow control requirements to initiate and maintain the supercavity, guidance and control systems are needed to provide the agility for close aboard engagements. An adaptive control design is proposed to assure performance for the inherent nonlinear dynamics of the free surface flow, the interactions between flow, cavity, and afterbody, and the diverse launch conditions and terminal states demanded by the problem.  A model-based framework is chosen in which neural network characterizations of the nonlinear dynamics are used in an online control design. Parameter identification and provably stable update laws are then added to adapt the models used for control decision to account for plant uncertainties, and lastly, a composite error control approach is incorporated to adaptively cancel unwanted nonlinearities in the responses.

In Mobius scheme, an arbitrary vector x in n-dimensional Euclidean space is expressed as the center of mass (or barycenter) of N point masses located at positions w1, w2,...,wN, and having masses m1, m2,...,mN, respectively (i.e., x = summation of (mk)(wk) from k = 1 to N, where the summation of (mk) = 1 from k = 1 to N. In this project we shall explore the use of an adaptive neural network technique for selecting nearly orthogonal point mass positions embedded within a statistical population of data block vectors to dramatically improve the performance of vector quantization data compression systems for communications. The idea is to transmit not only the nearest matching codebook vector, but a small set of qualified codebook vectors and their corresponding masses. In this way the original data vector can be accurately reconstructed as the barycenter of these masses with much less error and much igher compression than fixed transform (e.g., JPEG), vector quantization, eigenimage, and principal componant analysis approaches. A modest computational burden and real-time operation are inherent in the method, unlike fractal compression. The goal of Phase I will be to demonstrate 40:1 compression of video images with an RMS pixel value distortion of less than 10% in the decompressed imagery.

SPR bio-detection has been used for many years in biomedical research and drug development laboratories. Recent improvement in sensitivity and potentially lower cost enable the use of SPR-based biosensor in diagnostic application, including testing of pathogens, biomarkers, toxins and contaminants. However, current SPR instruments are susceptible to temperature-induced measurement errors that limit their use in the field. The thermal drift in SPR sensors is caused by the dependence of the refractive index of the sensor's optical medium and the sample material on ambient temperature. Currently, this thermal drift is mitigated in laboratory instruments by stabilizing the temperature in the instrument's test chamber and by incorporating temperature compensation channels into the sensor design. However, these active measures increase the instrument's complexity, cost, size and power consumption. The proposed temperature-independent SPR design addresses this fundamental deficiency and reduces by a factor of 100~1000 the thermal sensitivity of a waveguide-based SPR chip by matching the thermo-optic coefficients of the chip's optical substrate and the sample under test. If successful the proposed project will lead to expansion of the application range and market penetration of SPR biodetection technology.

BOX 2428,STATE UNIVERSITY,AR,72467,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal develops a technology that allows bioactive proteins to be synthesized and secreted from cultured plant cells in high yields and with prolonged serum half-life. The innovation of this technology, designated Hyp-Glyco, involves the expression of secreted therapeutic proteins as fusions with a novel hydroxyproline (Hyp)-Glyco tag. The Hyp-Glyco tag also extends serum half-life and facilitates purification of secreted proteins while retaining protein bioactivity. This proposal is focused on scale-up process development of Hyp-Glyco technology in bioreactor cultured tobacco cells expressing interferon 2b and in development of a cost-effective technique for protein recovery/purification. Specific aims of this feasibility Phase I are to 1) Establish bioreactor based high yield interferon protein production in plant cell cultures using Hyp-Glyco technology; 2) Demonstrate that continuous perfusion culture technology will further enhance protein production; and 3) Show that reliable and cost-effective recovery and purification of bioactive interferon protein can be achieved in bioreactor grown plant cell cultures. Success of Phase I will support a follow-up Phase II aimed at establishing cost-effective commercial level production protocols for all phases of this new protein production technology so as to provide the confidence necessary for investing in Phase III commercial development.  Protein therapeutics represents a multi-billion-dollar marketplace, but costly manufacturing methods for these drugs currently make them prohibitive for consumers. The broad impact of the proposed work resides in the potential of an alternative less costly platform for enhanced production of therapeutic proteins in plant cells which would, simultaneously, provide the added advantage of improved clinic effectiveness. Because this technology not only produces high-yield secreted proteins but also eliminates the time-consuming and expensive process of chemical derivatization to improve clinic effectiveness, the production costs can be significantly reduced. With the additional safety advantage of substituting plant cells for existing animal cell production,  molecular farming  could become commercially competitive with current mammalian and microbial cell production systems. Importantly, the interferon with extended serum half-life described here would meet a significant demand from 4 million hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients in USA and 3% of population worldwide. This technology is also broadly applicable to a wider range of therapeutically important proteins such as hGH, G-CSF and EPO etc, all of which represent billion-dollar markets. The development and success in commercializing the Hyp-Glyco protein manufacturing technology would create job opportunities in economically disadvantaged regions of the US and drive local economic development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The growing dual threat of environmental pollution and global warming is considered by most health/medical experts and governments as one of the most dangerous and intransigent potential health problems globally. The need for developing new health positive, cost conscious and environmentally sustainable technologies for production of industrial and pharmaceutical products is a high priority of health related research in the U.S. and abroad. This proposal will target this need directly by developing and testing the feasibility of innovative more cost-effective methods for producing therapeutic proteins by using plant-based cultures and bioreactors which will confer the simultaneously benefits of greater safety, energy conservative and environmental sustainability than traditional manufacturing methods.",DAVID RADIN,,(870) 897-7310,radin@biostrategies-lc.com,DAVID RADIN,,() -,,,,,"['commercial development', 'recovery/purification', 'Research phase', 'hepatitis c virus', 'applicant', 'purification', 'cell production system', 'cell production', 'recovery', 'local', 'market', 'innovation', 'technology production', 'technology', 'production', 'development', 'safety', 'protein production', 'expression', 'feasibility phase 1', 'test', 'effectiveness', 'Small Business Innovation', 'consumer', 'patient', 'plant-based culture bioreactor', 'scale-up process', 'manufacturing method', 'environmental pollution', 'cost', 'industrial', 'public', 'health problem', 'cost-effective', 'pharmaceutical product', 'continuous', 'phase', 'economic development', 'molecular farming', 'health', 'global warming']"

RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation in infants. It causes gt120,000 infant hospitalizations per year in the USA and is the leading cause of infant viral death. In the elderly, RSV causes one third of pneumonia hospitalizations. In children and adults, RSV infection is a major cause of acute asthma exacerbations. There is no licensed vaccine. Experimental RSV vaccines including inactivated, live attenuated, subunit, viral-vectored, and DNA have been developed and tested in animal models and small clinical trials. However, these have been largely unsuccessful. Inactivated and subunit vaccines have a history of causing immunopathology. Live attenuated RSV vaccines are safe. However, attenuated RSVs characteristically induce transient/poor immunity like wild-type RSV.    We are developing novel virus-like particle (VLP) RSV vaccines. VLPs are genetically engineered complexes of proteins in a particulate virus-like structure that lacks viral genetic material and therefore cannot replicate. Viral proteins presented as VLPs are highly immunogenic and induce protective humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses. We have extensive experience expressing viral proteins on VLPs and evaluating VLP-induced immunity. The RSV fusion (F) and attachment glycoprotein (G) contain all known neutralizing antibody epitopes and several T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that VLPs expressing RSV F, G, or both F and G surface will induce strong RSV-specific immune responses and immunity.    In Aim 1, we will generate VLPs using a recombinant baculovirus system to express VLP proteins in insect cells and gradient ultracentrifugation to purify VLPs. We have experience with these methods which are FDA approved for human use and scalable for production. We will generate RSV-G, RSV-F, and RSV-GF VLPs by co-expressing these proteins with influenza matrix M1 protein as the VLP core. VLPs co-expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) proteins exhibit enhanced cellular and humoral responses. We will generate RSV VLPs with and without anchored GM-CSF. Also, we will optimize immunogenicity by testing three different co-administered adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide (alum), CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), and monophosphoryl lipid (MPL). The latter two adjuvants stimulate toll- like receptor signaling pathways known to be important for anti-RSV responses. In Aim 2, we will define the immunogenicity and efficacy of these RSV VLP vaccines in a mouse model. Mice will be primed and boosted with VLPs intranasally. RSV-specific antibody (IgG and IgA) and T cell responses will be quantified after immunization. To determine protection, we will challenge mice with a recombinant, chimeric RSV strain known to give higher lung viral loads than laboratory RSV strain in BALB/c mice. Collectively, these experiments will advance RSV VLP vaccine development and may lead to a much needed approved RSV vaccine.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes apprimately 120,000 infant hospitalizations in the US each year and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Despite decades of research with traditional vaccine approaches, there are no approved RSV vaccines.

A Marx modulator controlled by solid-state switches promises higher efficiency, longer lifetime, and reduced cost compared to existing hard tube modulator options.  However, voltage droop is one of the critical challenges that limit the application of the Marx modulators.  The current approach to minimizing this problem, using vernier cells, is unable to smooth the flat top of the voltage pulse output, requiring an additional high voltage charging source and a large number of cells, which complicate the design of the Marx circuit.  This project will develop a new compensation scheme that exploits the high speed of solid-state switches and the circuit characteristics of additional inductance.  Phase I demonstrated that simple compensation circuitry based on this scheme can be implemented on an existing Marx main cell structure.  Simulations of the modified vernier cell showed compensation to within 1%. In Phase II, an 11 kV modified vernier cell will be designed and built.  After initial high voltage laboratory testing, the modified cell will be integrated into SLAC¿s Marx modulator for a real-time application test. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new compensation circuits should benefit the ILC project directly by meeting its stringent requirements for hundreds of modulators.

To minimize the effect on the environment, CO2 capture is required; but previous capture technologies have been both inefficient and expensive.  Coal Gasification can produce a CO2 rich gas at high temperature and pressure.  Removing the CO2 at high temperature and pressure and recovering that CO2 at pressure can improve both the efficiency and costs for capture.    TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a low cost, high capacity sorbent capable of removing CO2 at high temperatures.  TDAs system would be able to capture 95 percent CO2 with only 8 percent loss in plant work output (compared to the 20 percent loss common in the current designs).  The key to successful operation of the sorbent system for removal of carbon dioxide form hot fuel gas in IGCC power plants is a regenerable, very selective sorbent that has the structural integrity and absorption activity needed for multiple (many thousands) cycle operation.     In Phase I, we will prepare various sorbent formulations and screen them to determine their capacity for CO2 removal and optimize their regeneration conditions.  We would also test their long term durability through multiple cycle tests. Results:    Successful completion of Phase I will result in the production of a high capacity regenerable absorbent that can efficiently remove CO2 for sequestration from IGCC power plants. Potential Commercial Applications:    A successful sorbent developed in this project is expected to fine immediate commercial application in two markets; in the petrochemical industry for the production and hydrogen and natural gas/coal gasification power plants.

A Center for Disease Control and Prevention report highlights that 24% of adults and 17% of teenagers in the United States experience hearing loss in one or both ears from exposure to occupational or recreational loud sound. NIHL has a high prevalence among members of the armed forces and is a serious public health concern associated with loss of productivity, and high health care costs. Globally, occupational noise exposure is responsible for 16% of disabling hearing loss (over 600 million people); with significant lifetime costs per person in the US alone. While several pharmacological agents have shown promising results in preclinical trials and/or entered early clinical trials, at present there is no clinically available strategy to reduce or prevent NIHL. Preliminary and prior published results show that controlled and localized therapeutic hypothermia provided to the inner ear post-NIHL or post- mechanical trauma conserves significant residual hearing and preserves sensitive neural structures. The benefits of therapeutic hypothermia have long been discussed for improved neurological outcomes following traumatic brain injuries and cardiac arrest. This Phase I SBIR proposal will be used to design, build and test systems and protocols to deliver mild therapeutic hypothermia non-invasively to the inner ear during the critical time window following noise trauma. Using computational models of heat transfer and studies from cadaveric temporal bones, this study aims to translate such devices to clinical practice. Successful completion of these Phase I studies will enable Restor-Ear Devices LLC to submit a q-sub for an investigational device exemption (IDE) to the Food and Drug Administration and a future Phase II SBIR application to test efficacy and safety of therapeutic hypothermia against NIHL in human subjects. Considering that the prevalence of hearing loss is expected to increase significantly in the next few decades, these studies will be a first step toward establishing therapeutic hypothermia as a technique for preservation of hearing. It is likely that our systems will find further applications for protecting auditory and vestibular functions against ototoxic insults, traumatic brain injuries, blast exposures, and inner ear or middle ear surgeries.Public health relevance: The proposed work in this phase I SBIR application by Restor-Ear Devices LLC is aimed at designing and building prototype systems to deliver therapeutically safe, controllable and localized mild hypothermia to the human ears for conserving residual hearing and neural structures following noise overexposure.

The advantages of adding this layer are twofold.  First, since the absorption  takes place in a very thin layer instead of over a volume, it is inherently  lightweight.  And second, the orientation of the elements provide  directionality that can be optimized to capitalize on the fact that, for isolation  problems, the incidence angles are known.

By considering the temporal, spatial and accuracy characteristics of the weather sources as well as the information needs of pilots, our Weather Hazards Integrated Display System (WHIDS) will help pilots manage the presented information in order to maintain situation awareness and make better decisions. In Phase I, we will specify potential algorithms and display designs to help pilots understand the weather situation with respect to the decisions to be made. The emphasis will be on integrating real-time and forecast information in a pilot-centered way and on providing pilots the ability to support the types of decisions they have to make. In Phase II we will prototype and evaluate WHIDS.",Ruston Hunt,President,(770) 441-1457,russh@searchtech.com,Ellen Bass,Sr. Staff Engineer,(770) 441-1457,ellen@searchtech.com,,,,"['source', 'decision', 'Weather', 'weather', 'temporal', 'pilot-centered approach', 'hazard integrated display system', 'information', 'real-time', 'product', 'phase', 'spatial accuracy', 'awareness', 'cost', 'information flight', 'problem', 'algorithm']"

Developed during the WSF program, in-space vacuum deposition technology isnbsp;currently considered at TRL 8 andnbsp;consists of depositing materials atomic layer-by-atomic layer to fabricate functional thin films in the vacuum of space.nbsp;The concept consists of depositing a thick film layer of an element onto a material(s) through a physical vacuum deposition process in the vacuum of space. Considering the constraints for space flight (mass, volume, power, etc.) Lunar Resources has developed a specialized thermal deposition process to deposit coatings on-orbit which would be ideal for joining as it is low-power and is deployed by an autonomous, low-mass, space deposition system. The thermal deposition process coats the substrate (in this case the material to be joined) creating a bond between the substrate/material and the deposited coating. Lunar Resources has adapted the traditional terrestrial thermal deposition process to account for microgravity and overspray.nbsp;The space deposition systemnbsp;is able to create thick-films (gt;10microns) to join materials for bonding, repairing or replacing applications. and able to deposit a wide range of elements with vaporization temperatures up to 2000 oC. For joining applications, Lunar Resources foresees the benefit to deposit numerous coatings depending on the required strength of the bond and its application. For example, for joining two joints that will not need to be unjoined, Lunar Resources could deposit a nbsp;thick titanium coating. However, for joints that may need to be replaced or whose lifetimes are less than the structures which they are joining, we could deposit a lower melting temperature material such as indium to be able to unjoin and replace the joint by melting the deposited joining coating.nbsp;",Elliot Carol,,(646) 455-8382,elliot@lunarresources.space,Alex Ignatiev,,(713) 202-6043,alex@lunarresources.space,,,,"['power', 'in-space vacuum deposition technology', 'strength bond application', 'volume', 'material(s ) physical vacuum', 'temperature', 'Lunar Resources adapt', 'material bonding', 'wsf program', 'space deposition system', 'low-mass', 'Lunar Resources propose novel', 'atomic layer-by-atomic layer', 'vacuum space', 'deposition', 'layer element', 'indium', 'element vaporization', 'low-power', 'in-space', 'on-orbit', 'melting temperature material', 'case material', 'bond substrate/material deposit', 'Lunar Resources deposit', 'Lunar Resources foresee']"

RD,,Columbia,SC,29229-4339,DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   NMR is arguably the most powerful analytical technique for structure determination and function elucidation in molecules of all types  but there are complex challenges for biological macromolecules  Dynamic Nuclear Polarization  DNP  with Magic Angle Spinning  MAS  has recently demonstrated S N gains of up to two orders of magnitude at      K  the lower temperature bound using N  MAS technology  compared to conventional NMR MAS in many solids  Despite this enormous benefit  the adaptation rate of DNP will be severely limited by its very high price tag  $   M   mostly because DNP experiments at field strengths greater     T and operating in the        K range require an expensive gyrotron for the high power millimeter wave  mmw  irradiation  and that in turn requires a special magnet with superconducting sweep coils   Preliminary experiments at     K  that consumed liquid helium at the rate of up to     L day  have shown the potential for the use of low power solid state mmw sources and order of magnitude higher S N for DNP   if suitable MAS DNP probes could be developed  However    K MAS DNP will necessitate helium recycling  improved sample spinner designs  and a number of additional technical advances   This SBIR project will enable   K MAS DNP by developing   A  the needed high stability    K helium spinner technology   B  the needed high efficiency closed loop cryogenic helium recycling system   C  complete quad resonance and quint resonance multi nuclear   H   F X Y e  and  H   F  X Y Z e   DNP probes with auto sample exchange and variable temperature  VT  operation from    K to     K  The probes will be demonstrated at   T       T     T  and      T using a combination of facilities at DSI  the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  and customers   Compared to current state of the art      K  MAS DNP instrumentation  the proposed fully optimized MAS DNP probes at    K will often improve sample throughput by one to two orders of magnitude  The information needed for determining detailed molecular structures could then be obtained on many complex biomolecules  catalysts  and other solids in a few hours rather than days or weeks  As demonstrated during the Phase I  the combination of increased Boltzmann factor  dramatically reduced rf circuit noise temperature  and substantially increased circuit Q  combine to yield most of these throughput gains  Additional significant gains will come from incorporation of a gradient coil for coherence selection  Reduction in system cost will stem from the dramatic increase in T e below    K  enabling the use of low  cost solid state millimeter wave sources and standard wide bore magnets   The helium purification and recycling system this project will develop to enable   K DNP will also make it straightforward and cost effective for the facility to implement recycling fo all the helium it requires for its cryo magnets  The additional hardware required for helium liquefaction will be relatively minor  Hence  not only will this project advance throughput of solis NMR by more than an order of magnitude  it will also enable cost effective recycling of helium at the larger NMR facilities PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Thousands of researchers regularly use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  NMR  techniques  A majority of the applications is now driven by the need for structure and function determination in biological macromolecules  The advances developed under this project will make it possible for any NMR laboratory that has a wide bore magnet to begin applying Dynamic Nuclear Polarization  DNP  to solids on a budget they will be able to afford  This would equip biomedical researchers with superb new tools for

This approach uses the User Interface Markup Language (UIML), an open specification language being standardized byOASIS, as a user interface design language that can be rendered to usability prototypes, tactical HCI code, and object model representations.  The proposed approach centers on defining an enhanced, UIML-based user interface design process, and thendefining tool support needs for this process.  The intent is to span the gap between usability and object-oriented software engineering by supporting rapid prototyping of user interfaces for usability engineering, while providing the ability to generateobject design data for the overall system's object model and tactical HCI code for deployment.  UIML and its associated tools form a bridge between the user interface designer and the application modeler, allowing early and frequent integration of the userinterface design process and the application development life cycle.  A process that simplifies the creation of user interfaces by facilitating the transition from usability prototypes to tactical HCI software will improve product quality and reducedevelopment time.  This process will further allow access to multiple applications, possibly including legacy applications, through a single user interface, and also allow multiple user interfaces tailored to users' roles, responsibilities, even thecomputing devices used to access the application.

Box 3027,,Bellevue,WA,98009,"ABSTRACT:The objective of this solicitation is to develop real-time automatic scaling software for oblique ionograms (OIs). The NWRA team has developed an extensive HF propagation computational tool set, which includes a capability called APEx (Automated Point Extraction) for automatically finding vertical ionogram (VI) traces within an ionogram image. APEx does not require pre-separation of the O- and X-modes of the ionogram (although this is beneficial). We will extend Apex to OIs. We show in this proposal that APEx can already be used to select OI trace points, but we will refine APEx substantially during the proposed effort. Using recently-developed mathematical concepts of sparsity and fractional norms, we will develop a robust method for selecting the desired trace data and determining whether a given point is O or X while reducing selection of noise/interference data. A selected OI trace could be converted to an approximately equivalent VI using the laws of virtual geometry (VG) and inverted to an electron density profile, but this is an unnecessarily inaccurate method. We will instead assimilate the OI trace data directly into NWRAs assimilative ionosphere model, GPSII (GPS Ionospheric Inversion). This approach allows for ionospheric horizontal gradients that would be lost in the VG approach.BENEFIT:An automated system for finding oblique ionogram trace points will allow for real time assimilation of potentially dense networks of ionosondes. The Australian DSTO has already fielded such a network, the Dense Integrated Network of Ionospheric Sensors (DINIS), for defining the propagation environment of their OTH radar system, JORN. A similar networked sounding system has been proposed for the US Next Generation OTH Radar (NGOTHR). Making best use of the ionograms provided by an ionospheric sounding network to improve the geolocation accuracy of NGOTHR will require a direct 3D ionospheric data assimilation algorithm like NWRAs GPS Ionospheric Inversion (GPSII). For GPSII to function without a human in the loop, as will be necessary for the throughput required of NGOTHR, automated trace extraction will be required. This capability will also benefit the intelligence community. A limitation of HF geolocation of emitters in denied territories is the inability to measure the ionosphere in the denied region using vertical ionosondes. However, it is often completely reasonable to propagate over a denied region using oblique-incidence HF paths, that is, oblique ionograms. GPSII is already being evaluated in the IARPA HFGeo program and has proven to provide unparalleled accuracy in accounting for the signal deflections caused by medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). A reliable OI autoscaling capability will extend the benefit of GPSII to HFGeo in denied territories.",Matthew Pruis,,(425) 556-9055,contracts-grants@nwra.com,L.J.

Therefore, this project will develop a remotely operable, multi-channel radiometer designed specifically for the measurement of atmospheric water vapor and liquid water in arid regions.  The radiometer, which will combine state-of-the-art RF design techniques with novel processing algorithms, will operate near the 183 GHz water vapor line to provide the best means for measuring low levels of atmospheric water vapor.  Phase I investigated the optimal instrument configuration for measuring low levels of integrated water vapor and liquid water, as well as the ability to generate vertical profiles of water vapor.  In order to estimate these quantities, an artificial neural network algorithm, trained on data from the DOE Cloud and Radiation Test (CART) site in Barrow, Alaska, was developed.  This algorithm was also used to demonstrate the ability of an uncalibrated radiometer to measure these same quantities with somewhat reduced accuracy.  Phase II will build two high performance radiometers for deployment at the Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska CART sites.  A compact, lower cost 183 GHz radiometer, capable of providing similar data without the need for internal calibration loads or a scanning antenna, also will be built.

The proposed sensor is based on ultra rapid determination of the equilibrium shape of a miniscule drop of a probe liquid on the surface in question, a parameter directly related to the Gibbs free energy of the surface. The research objectives are to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between ballistic deposition parameters of small liquid drops, the morphology and energetics of a substrate surface, and the equilibrium drop geometry, and utilize this knowledge to design and construct prototype closed loop control surface processing equipment. This understanding will be developed primarily through high-speed imaging of the interaction of growing droplets with surfaces of various chemical composition and morphology. This knowledge will be incorporated into the design and construction of prototype surface processing equipment that includes closed loop feedback for precise control and verification of surface free energy.",Giles Dillingham,,(513) 469-1800,gdillingham@btglabs.com,Giles Dillingham,,(513) 469-1800,gdillingham@btglabs.com,,,,"['manufacturer medical device', 'chemical composition', 'surface treatment process', 'electronic', 'treatment equipment', 'adhesive bonding', 'market', 'technology', 'treatment process', 'surface', 'printing', 'water-borne system', 'energetic substrate surface', 'manufacturer general purpose surface', 'Gibbs free energy surface', 'theoretical practical knowledge', 'project', 'food packaging', 'sensor base ultra rapid determination', 'surface processing', 'consumer', 'solvent-based', 'knowledge design', 'geometry', 'relationship', 'surface treatment', 'treatment', 'design', 'manufacturing method', 'quality', 'industrial', 'bond coat structure', 'scrap rate', 'research', 'high-speed imaging', 'ballistic deposition', 'surface free energy', 'automotive oem?s supplier', 'control surface', 'destructive testing', 'construction', 'feedback control', 'equilibrium', 'critical control process', 'supplier']"

Thermionic emission allows waste heat to be converted, but traditional thermionic materials provide very low conversion efficiencies at the moderate temperatures (400-600Â°C) found in an automobile exhaust system.  Thus, there is a need to develop direct thermal-to-electric converters with high conversion efficiencies at moderate temperatures.  This project will build and test a new cathode material, graded band gap AlGaN, which has a surface with a negative electron affinity.  These materials are efficient electron emitters at lower temperatures than traditional metal thermionic materials.  In Phase I, the thermionic emission properties of the materials will be measured.  A pre-prototype converter, which can be mounted in the automobile exhaust system and is capable of efficient conversion, will be designed and manufactured.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The conversion technology should provide high energy density electrical power sources for automobiles, aircraft, and space vehicles.  The technology also should find application in the conversion of waste heat from chemical and other manufacturing processes into useable electrical energy, thereby cutting costs and reducing negative environmental effects.

Investigations of the mechanisms linking shift work and disease have highlighted the importance of nocturnal light exposure and the consequent chronic disruption of circadian organization. Recent evidence that light input to the circadian system is mediated by neural systems distinct, anatomically and functionally, from those involved in vision provides a theoretical foundation for addressing this pathophysiology in shift workers. Recent work has demonstratedthat the use of filtering lenses to eliminate the deep blue end of the visual spectrum (lt  480nm) significantly improves nocturnal alertness and performance, and normalizes endocrine and genetic indices of circadian organization. This Phase I SBIR application seeks to build on this initial finding by developing spectrum-specific, indoor LED lighting solutions that provide usable indoor illumination absent the spectral components that are associated with circadian disruption. Indoor lighting that could be used at night without producing circadian disruption, providing the potential for immediate improvements in alertness and performance and long-term improvements in shift worker health, would have significant potential application in the large and growing segment of the modern economy that requires night work. This Phase I SBIR project will address two specific aims in anticipation of Phase II clinical testing. 1) We will construct prototype fixtures using LEDs with a notch filter that eliminates the implicated blue (460-480nm) band; and 2) we will test whether illumination to normal indoor work intensities can be achieved without disrupting an index of normal circadian organization (i.e. melatonin secretion), using an overnight laboratory study protocol withtest subjects. Based on the results of this initial effort, planned Phase II studies will examine the impact of spectrum-specific lighting in real shift work settings using additional outcome measures of performance and health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a Phase I SBIR application seeking support for the development of filtered LED bulbs for use in shift work settings. Epidemiological research suggests that light exposure during the night hours on a shift work schedule has significant adverse impact on the health of the shift worker. The disruption in internal timing caused by nocturnal light is associated with an increase in the risk of heart disease, obesity and certain kinds of cancer. More recently, it has been shown that the harmful effectsof the light may be due to a small component of the blue light fraction of the visual spectrum. By filtering this component out of the light used to illuminate shift work settings, the harmful effects of shift work may be reduced. Studies in simulated shift work suggest that filtering out the blue light component results in normalization of the rhythms in hormone secretion (melatonin and cortisol) and increases in alertness and vigilance performance during the night work hours. ZircLight is seeking SBIR support for the development and testing of LED bulbs with attached filters to remove the deleterious portion of the visual spectrum. These bulbs would be used in shift work settings such as hospitals and factories to provide illumination without the blue component. If successful, this project could provide substantial health benefits for millions of US workers who are required to work the night shift.",MARTIN EDE,,(781) 676-6901,mme@circadian.com,ANNEKE HEITMANN,,(781) 439-6300,aheitmann@circadian.com,Stub,,,"['testing', 'disruption', 'applicant', 'deep blue end visual spectrum', 'spectrum-specific', 'risk heart disease', 'filter blue light component', 'work disease', 'neural system', 'indoor lighting use night', 'adverse impact', 'modern economy', 'outcome measure', 'long-term', 'nocturnal light', 'lighting solution', 'internal timing', 'cancer', 'normalization rhythm hormone secretion', 'application', 'laboratory study protocol', 'performance', 'development', 'epidemiological research', 'project', 'illumination blue component', 'exposure', 'spectrum-specific lighting real shift work setting', 'harmful effect', 'clinical testing', 'work intensity', 'spectrum-specific lighting shift', 'plan phase', 'work night', 'public', 'effectsof light small component blue light fraction', 'potential', 'shift worker', 'visual spectrum', 'filter component light', 'endocrine genetic index', 'illumination', 'circadian system', 'phase', 'obesity', 'night work', 'gastrointestinal disease', 'health shift', 'health']"

These resonators have been designed using low-risk, conventional fabrication techniques that are ideally suited to making mm- to cm-sized ultra-high precision devices. At mm-wave frequencies, these resonators can best be described as tunable foreshortened coaxial resonators. The proposed mm-wave devices will have an unloaded Q of up to 2000 and full-octave tuning ranges, for example from 25 to 50 Ghz, although any full-octave tuning range up to the limitations of the packaging and interconnections can be constructed.

In this proposal, the company will advance development of our potential therapeutic, SPY-DYS45-55, a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in conjunction with research partners at UCLA. Duchenne is a devastating muscle wasting disorder with no cure that is caused by out-of-frame mutations in the DMD gene. SPY-DYS45-55 removes a mutational hotspot in DMD to restore the reading frame for half of all Duchenne patients by generating an in-frame exon 45-55 deletion. This deletion is associated with a very mild phenotype in human Becker muscular dystrophy patients. Systemic delivery of gene editing platforms to muscle represents a significant challenge. Certain serotypes of recombinant adenoassociated virus (AAV) have tropism to skeletal muscle and heart. However, the immune response to the virus prohibits repeated administration of AAV. Furthermore, pre-existing immunity in some individuals (anticipated to be present in up to 70% of adults), precludes their eligibility to take advantage of this treatment. The goal of this Fast Track proposal is to devise strategies to overcome these challenges. In Phase I, we will determine an optimal immunosuppression regimen that allows redosing of AAV in order to improve the efficacy and applicability of SPY-DYS45-55. In Phase II, we will assess the long-term functional benefit, toxicity, and off-target activity from single or multiple injections of AAV-SPY-DYS45-55 in our novel mouse model containing a mutated human DMD gene.

Our approach has two major highly coupled parts: 1) Data fusion module. Mutliple-sensor data are fused to perform situation awareness. To generate the intent inference of the targets, we will extend Markov games via incorporating Multi-Cumulant Pareto Nash strategies and Graph concept. From a perspective of distributed decision making problem, we dynamically adapt Hierarchical Task Network and Auction algorithm for optimal meta-task decomposition and assignment. A collaborative search and tracking oriented sensor management algorithm based on Pursuit-Evasion game will be exploited to improve the performance of the multi-layered sensing system. 2) Data-mining module. Adaptation and pattern/feature recognition are carried out to dynamically select (or mine) appropriate features or feature sets and quickly associate them with the adversary intent and executable actions. In some time-critical scenarios, firstly, a primitive adversary intent estimation and the associated friendly force collaborative response actions can be quickly provided by the Data-mining module. Then, a refinement based on data-fusion will be carried out to improve the performance of the decision aids tool. Additionally, we will incorporate a semantic and textual processing technique to convert meta-tasks into actionable fusion processes  BENEFIT: The proposed game theoretic decision aid tool for cooperative system modeling, simulation, and analysis has tremendous applications potential in many military applications. It can also be directly used for developing of advanced mission planning and emergency preparedness decision support systems such as Space Situational Awareness Fusion Intelligent Research Environment [SAFIRE] program, BMDS system, Future Combat System (FCS), Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, JSSEO program, and AEGIS program.

The two chemotherapeutic agents used most commonly are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine. Several randomized clinical trials have shown that gemcitabine was slightly better with an overall response rate of 17% and median survival of 5.7 months. Some encouraging results have been observed when gemcitabine is locally administrated to treat patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic tumors. However, the improvement in survival rate is limited due to the lack of an appropriate delivery technology. The challenge in treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer remains how to deliver the therapeutic agents directly to the tumors at a high concentration and yet maintain low systemic concentration so that side effects are minimized. FeRx proposes to evaluate the use of magnetically targeted carriers (MTCs) to deliver gemcitabine to pancreatic tumors. MTCs are magnetic microparticles composed of metallic iron and activated carbon capable of binding a wide variety of pharmaceutical agents. MTCs are administered via intra-arterial administration and are localized to the tumors using an externally positioned magnet. FeRx proposes to develop MTC-Gemcitabine to investigate the feasibility to deliver high local concentration of gemcitabine specifically to the pancreas. Preliminary results have indicated that gemcatibine can be used with the MTC technology. In order to prove the usefulness of MTC technology to deliver the drug to pancreas, FeRx proposes: 1) to complete the optimization of the binding and release properties of gemcitabine onto the MTCs and develop the supporting analytical methods, 2) to characterize the in vitro properties of MTC-Gemcitabine, and 3) to evaluate in vivo the effects of MTC-Gemcitabine magnetically delivered to the pancreas of normal swine.",JACQUELINE JOHNSON,,(858) 677-7788,JJOHNSON@FERX.COM,YUHUA LI,,(720) 859-4090,YLI@FERX.COM,,,,"['delivery technology', 'response rate', 'tumor', 'analytical method', 'mtc technology', 'gemcitabine mtc', 'applicant', 'magnetically target carrier', 'magnetic microparticle', 'intra-arterial', 'cancer', 'pancreatic cancer', 'effect', 'bind', 'optimization', 'low', 'mtc-gemcitabine investigate', 'randomized clinical trial', 'property', 'mtc-gemcitabine', 'patient unresectable', 'iron activate', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'mtc', 'local concentration', 'survival rate limit', 'pharmaceutical agent', 'systemic concentration effect']"

BOX 71,HANOVER,NH,03755,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to design, fabricate, and test co-located earphones/microphones for use in in- ear, active noise reduction (ANR) systems. Our innovation is based on a micromachined membrane that serves  as both the sensing element for a microphone and simultaneously the actuation surface for the earphone. By collocating the earphone and microphone, our device eliminates the acoustic phase delay between the ANR sensor and actuator, thereby enabling feedbac k algorithms with higher gain at higher frequency than is possible using separate devices. Current hearing protection designs provide approximately 30 dB of attenuation at the ear. This level of protection is not sufficient to allow long exposures in many  industrial noise environments (which may exceed 130 dB) while maintaining the at-the-ear sound levels within prescribed safety limits. In order to keep within current NIOSH and OSHA noise exposure standards, new technologies are needed that will protect in dividuals from long-term exposure to harmful noise levels that could potentially result in temporary or permanent hearing threshold shifts. During the Phase I project, we demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation by fabricating and testing prototypica l devices. The results we achieved showed the sensitivity of our microphone design, demonstrated the sound production capability of our earphone design, provided a manufacturing plan for fabrication of the co-located earphone/microphone during Phase II, an d demonstrated the noise reduction capability over the frequency range of 300 Hz 8000 Hz.

In particular, gearbox components experience continuous cyclic loading, wear and eventually develop fatigue cracks. As opposed to most other aircraft components, gearbox components are non-redundant, so a failure can have catastrophic consequences. Gearbox members are typically magnesium, aluminum or high-strength steel that exhibit high fracture toughness, but are brittle, making them susceptible to fatigue failure. Gearbox safety can be ensured via real-time detection methods. Current monitoring systems fail to detect damage in at early enough stage to provide sufficient warning before failure, or may cause false positives. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis of gearbox health state can reduce maintenance schedules, and component life may be extended, which lead to significant life-cycle cost reduction. This proposal focuses on the development of a gearbox PHM system for early detection of cracking. The system will be hybrid in nature, relying on both passive acquisition of elastic waves in operation, as well as active excitation of guided waves while on the ground. Both techniques will make use of model-augmented pattern recognition techniques to characterize an accurate real-time state of health for the gearbox.

Between 75% and 90% of these are mild or moderate injuries. These can inflict profound and persistent impairment of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. The physical, social and economic sequelae of TBI can persist for the victim's entire life, a burden that is borne by the individual, their family, and by society. However, mild and moderate TBI is challenging to diagnose. Conventional methods such as imaging and neurological examination are often insensitive to mild injury. There is no blood- based diagnostic tool to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of mild and moderate TBI. However, such a rapid, reliable, and sensitive tool would greatly improve diagnosis and triage of TBI patients, would more accurately guide treatment and management options, and therefore would improve patient outcome while reducing management costs. Banyan Biomarkers Inc. has been recognized as a pioneer in the development of ultra-sensitive brain injury biomarker diagnostic assays. We have the commitment to providing such a tool to the marketplace, based on proprietary TBI biomarkers. Previously, in our Phase I SBIR project, a sensitive ELISA for quantifying one brain injury biomarker (BA0123) in CSF was successfully developed, and proof-of-concept data confirming that BA0123 is increased in CSF following brain injury was obtained from preclinical studies. Subsequently, a second complementary neuro-biomarker (BA0252) was discovered and a specific ELISA assay for its sensitive detection was developed. Proof-of-concept data to support the hypothesis that both biomarkers are increased in CSF and serum of human patients with severe TBI was generated and preliminary data show detection of these markers also in mild and moderate TBI patients. The data supporting the development of both biomarkers as tools to aid in the diagnosis of TBI are very compelling. In Phase II of this project a commercializable ELISA assay kit for both biomarkers (BA0123 and BA0252) will be developed. Assay components (antibodies and antigens) will be produced in abundant supply and under quality assured conditions. Feasibility data will be collected from clinical studies of severe, moderate, and mild TBI that will allow correlation of biomarker levels to clinical measures of injury severity, disease progression, and outcome. The accuracy with which the biomarkers can discriminate magnitude of injury, and patients that are likely to have poor progression and outcome will be evaluated. This analysis will determine the sensitivity and specificity of markers BA0123 and BA0252 when used singularly or in combination. These data will be used to support a pre-IDE application to the FDA. The deliverables of this Phase II project are two quality-assured ELISA assays for the brain injury biomarkers establishing the foundation toward their commercialization. These assays will be used to analyze clinical samples, further confirming the use of the biomarkers as tools to aid in the diagnosis of severe, mild and moderate TBI.    Each year in the United States at least 1.4 million people sustain a TBI, of which about 50,000 die, 235,000 are hospitalized, and 1.1 million are treated and released from an emergency department. Current methods used to assess the existence and severity of brain injury, based on imaging techniques such as CT scanning or MRI, are expensive, not consistently reliable, not universally available, and are slow to produce results.

Project activities focused on achieving a magnetic field that shields the discharge channel from ion induced erosion.  The goal is to achieve a propellant throughput greater than 100 kg/kW.  Numerical modeling is playing a critical role in the thruster design.  In Phase I, we used a fluid based code developed by JPL to model the plasma in an existing thruster that is currently undergoing life testing.  The erosion predictions of the model were found to agree well with actual measurements.  The numerical model was then applied to the magnetically shielded 1-kW thruster and preliminary results were found to be reasonable.  The goal is to demonstrate a thruster design where channel erosion is entirely eliminated as a life limiting mechanism.  In Phase II, we will build and test the extended lifetime thruster.  The performance, lifetime, and plume properties of the thruster will then be evaluated, and the design will be optimized.  Numerical modeling will be used throughout the process to ensure that magnetic shielding is achieved.  Code predictions will be grounded in plasma measurements taken with a variety of diagnostics including channel wall probes, high speed intrusive channel probes, and plume probes.  The ability of the thruster to achieve its lifetime goals will be assessed through a 500 hour wear test.  When the design is finalized, an engineering development unit (EDU) thruster will be designed, built, validated, and delivered to NASA.

The cost of transmission grid inspections and maintenance may decrease, leading to more frequent routine inspection and more timely and proactive inspections of infrastructure with potential for failure. Transmission grid operators may have a more resilient grids with lower losses thanks to increased and improved data from frequent inspections. The American people can potentially benefit from a more resilient grid with fewer outages and more consistent delivery of electricity. Fewer line losses conserve energy and reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned to generate electricity locally.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) inspection capabilities enabling access to utility infrastructure unreachable and/or difficult to reach by current methods. Inspection, maintenance, repair, and auditing processes for electrical utility infrastructure are costly and hazardous to personnel.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will explore a photovoltaic technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart windows over the same spatial footprint without competing for visible or infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate. Scientific broader impacts from this project include contributions to the understanding of structure-property relationships governing organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layer composition and resulting visible light transmittance. Phase II technical deliverables will include demonstration of a NUV solar module with world-leading visible transparency.

Dynamic glass, is a proven approach to reduce the energy consumption in DoD buildings. Unfortunately, COTS dynamic window technologies are expensive (on the order of $100-$150/sq ft installed). Moreover, the installation of dynamic window requires full demolition and replacement of the existing windows. This level of construction activity results in high installation expenses and the displacement of occupant.  What is needed is a technology that is cost-efficient and easily retrofit onto existing windows. Furcifer has developed such a solution – a laminable electrochromic window film that is produced using modern roll-to-roll printing technologies at 1/5 to 1/10 the cost of traditional dynamic glass at the same scale, and is the first EC film that can be directly applied to existing windows as an aftermarket application. By directly laminating the film onto the window glass, existing windows are retrofit into dynamic windows. Furcifer’s utilizes next-generation, flexible electrochromic (EC) film that can be manufactured via standard wet methods such as roll-to-roll printing. Furcifer has created soluble electrochromic inks and electrolytes to enable fabrication directly onto flexible substrates such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide, a transparent conductor) on PET (polyethylene terephthalate, a common plastic). This  leads to a weight reduction of 100x over glass. By bypassing expensive semiconductor and vacuum deposition and for low-cost printing methods, Furcifer has eliminated 99% of the capital cost of production. The low manufacturing capex and the light weight of the EC films, allows Furcifer to geographically distribute manufacturing further reducing shipping costs and the total energy cost of the installed product. The EC films can be shipped to any DoD’s global facility with minimum shipping cost. Furcifer’s robust, flexible EC film can be laminated onto any flat or curved surface, making it very easy to retrofit the existing DoD’s IGUs. It does not require demolition of the original window or displacement of occupants in operational facilities. In this way, Furcifer’s EC film has the potential to break the primary barriers to adoption of dynamic windows for DoD installations. If broadly adopted, the EC technology could reduce global DoD facility energy consumption by up to 10% with total facilities peak load reductions of up to 25%. Such reductions broadly implemented could ease existing strain on the national grid. Overall, the EC film technology addresses two of DoD’s three key installation energy goals: (1) reduce energy usage/intensity and (2) improve energy security",Aegis Creek,,(415) 867-9065,ACUSG.Furcifer@gmail.com,Jian Wang,,(510) 516-6909,jianwang@furciferinc.com,,,,"['operational facility', 'dynamic glass scale', 'strain', 'solution', 'fabrication', 'next-generation', 'manufacturing', 'indium Tin oxide', 'technology', 'construction activity', 'application', 'dynamic', 'surface', 'global dod facility energy', 'energy security', 'instal product', 'deposition', 'U.S. Department Defense great performance', 'RT&L area Control Communications', 'cost', 'displacement', 'global facility', 'potential', 'polyethylene terephthalate', 'manufacture', 'low-cost printing method', 'National Defense Strategy line 3', 'wet method roll-to-roll printing', 'roll-to-roll printing']"

Energy use in buildings represents roughly 40% of total U.S. energy demand. It is projected that over half the buildings that will be in use in 2050 are already built. Retrofitting existing buildings with smart windows that regulate/monitor sunlight transmission could reduce building energy consumption by 10 - 40% and represents a $64B total addressable market, but is presently prohibitively complex and labor intensive. Transparent, NUV solar cells will simplify smart glass/film adoption by obviating the need for external wiring, thereby catalyzing deployment of smart window technologies in existing buildings to increase energy efficiency and enhance occupant health and productivity. Similarly, IoT smart devices/sensors promise to make the built environment more efficient by giving users more control over appliances, information, and energy use. Transparent NUV solar cells can provide point-of-use power to in-window IoT devices/sensors without altering aesthetics. For the photovoltaic community, the operation physics and performance of the NUV photovoltaic technology developed through this program will be of broader interest, as NUV wavelengths are inefficiently harvested by conventional photovoltaics. The proposed project will explore a photovoltaic technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart windows monolithically without competing for visible or near-infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate or imposing design constraints on window aesthetics. First-generation NUV solar cells exhibit power scalability with area, and single-junction photovoltages exceeding 1.6 V (record for thin-film PV). This Phase I project aims to (1) translate NUV solar technology from rigid glass to a flexible substrate, and (2) demonstrate use of low-cost transparent electrode alternatives. These breakthroughs will allow for facile integration of NUV solar cells with smart windows for self-powered operation and intelligent management of the solar spectrum, with NUV photons powering the regulation of visible and near-infrared photons for natural lighting and heating purposes, respectively. Additionally, the aesthetically-discreet nature of flexible, transparent NUV solar cells can enable remotely-powered internet-of-things (IoT) smart devices/sensors. Accordingly, funding for this Phase I project will produce a flexible, transparent NUV solar cell prototype for field-testing with smart window and IoT device technologies.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a turnkey sputter deposition system to provide low temperature thin film deposition of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials. A laboratory scale film deposition system using a closed-field magnetron sputtering with RF plasma enhancement was demonstrated. The thin films were grown at lower temperatures than most competing processes. One key advantage of the deposition process developed is its ability to produce TCOs without the need for post-treatments (to achieve both good resistivity and transparency) thereby simplifying the process compatible for high-volume processing of large flat polymeric substrates. The project will demonstrate the process compatible with alternative TCO materials and with photovoltaic applications.  The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be innovations in photovoltaic (PV) technology. The ability to tap solar energy more efficiently will lead to major breakthroughs for many devices. For years, silicon (Si) solar cells have been the backbone of the solar industry using monocrystalline Si substrate with multiple layers of p-n junction diodes. However, one of the main limiting factors is the shortage of silicon for PV applications as it competes with the existing requirements in the semiconductor industry. Many different PV alternatives are in active development which utilizes TCO materials to provide the conductive anode, cathode, or both. Thin film solar cells provide a good alternative to Si-based solar cells as long as the fabrication cost can be reduced. Thin film solar cells use layers of semiconducting materials with little micrometer thickness and deposited on glass, stainless steel or flexible substrates. One cost-effective method to produce PV devices is through the use of polymers. However, the current device performance of polymer-based PV devices is low but can further be improved by fabricating metal oxide semiconductors embedded on the polymer-based device structure.

Newer technologies, including Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are highly promising replacements for existing products (based on the incandescent light bulb technology) if the manufacturing yield can be improved. A key goal of OLED manufacture is to create devices on flexible substrates like plastic films.

Furthermore, instead of expensive optical detection this nanosensor will detect hybridization by changes in electrical conductivity that can be made with a simple, low cost, low power instrument compatible with a point of care or even portable sensor platform. This detection system is based on the discovery that nanoscale materials such as nanotubes and nanowires can act as field effect transistors (FET's) at room temperature. This effect is termed NanoChemFET and it works because the conductive properties of exquisitely sensitive nanowires are modulated by charges on the analyte molecule that act like a gate voltage in a conventional field effect transistor. Because captured DNA or RNA would deliver a defined number of negative charges, proportional to the number of nucleotides brought into the vicinity of the nanowire, nucleic acids are well-suited to sensitive, quantitative analysis by a NanoChemFET sensor. As described in this proposal we will develop processes to controllably manufacture nanowires and assemble them on functional devices. We will use these devices to test the sensor performance for sensing and discriminating specific DNA sequences. In phase I of the program we will detect hybridization of a specific DNA sequence and we will determine the basal sensitivity and discriminatory capabilities of the sensor. This will provide the baseline from which to develop multiple genomic analysis applications including expression arrays, SNP genotyping and the detection of infectious agents in an exquisitely sensitive, rapid and cost effective manner.", ,,(650) 331-2100,,R DANIELS,,(650) 331-2108,HDANIELS@NANOSYSINC.COM,,,,"['testing', 'effective', 'applicant', 'nanotechnology', 'time sensitivity', 'device test', 'temperature', 'individual', 'quantitative analysis', 'technology', 'program', 'gate voltage conventional field effect', 'functional device', 'process', 'material nanotube', 'portable sensor platform', 'multiple', 'snp genotyping detection', 'phase program detect', 'optical detection', 'expression array', 'low', 'effect term', 'low power instrument', 'detection system base', 'electrical conductivity', 'sample labeling amplification', 'sensitive', 'information', 'colorectal cancer', 'detection', 'genetic analysis', 'cost', 'proportional number nucleotide', 'point care', 'basal sensitivity discriminatory', 'genomic analysis', 'manufacture', 'instrumentation', 'field effect transistor', 'negative charge', 'susceptibility disease', 'treatment disease']"

This project demonstrates the potential of this design for increased efficiency and low cost by prototyping single-layer solar cells with spectral responses tuned to the solar spectrum. The research develops approaches to explore the four main technical areas that are currently limiting nanocomposite photovoltaic cell performance: illumination intensity saturation, conduction efficiency, charge-separation efficiency and dispersal control of nanomaterials in a host matrix of high concentration. In Phase I, these technical areas are explored to determine the magnitude of potential performance improvements that can be achieved by optimizing these parameters in Phase II; and compare these projections to the maximum performance predicted by theory. In Phase II, the information gathered in Phase I will be used to produce a prototype of an optimized, lightweight, low-cost, flexible solar cell with efficiency greater than 10%; amenable to large-scale, low-temperature manufacturing.  Commercial applications exist for high performance, low-cost solar cells that can provide an alternative power generation source.

The principle of the nanowire FED sensor has been demonstrated by Prof. Charlies Lieber's group at Harvard University. The technology requires no label and combines the specificity of antibody-antigen binding with the exquisitely high sensitivity associated with electrical properties of semiconductor nanowires to achieve near single molecule detection.  Our objective in this phase I program is to demonstrate the selectivity and sensitivity of nanowire FET nanosensors for anthrax detection. We will develop chemistry for the immobilization of anti-anthrax antibody on the surface of Si nanowires, establish a process for the fabrication of nanowire FET sensors, optimize electrical signal response of devices upon anthrax maker, protective antigen (PA) binding, and measure the detection limits and dynamic response of the devices at physiologically relevant concentrations.The proposed studies will define fundamental properties of nanowire sensors for selective detection of the biomolecular marker under in-vitro conditions. We believe that these studies will lay the groundwork for developing a very exciting and important program for the NIH. The nanowire nanosensor devices developed in this project will serve as a stepping stone to the creation of minimally-invasive in-vivo sensors for real-time monitoring, and moreover, could be used to develop devices that could simultaneously monitor a large set of protein markers in patients known to be high risk - this could lead to detection at a stage simply not possible today. Lastly, integrated nanosensor arrays could serve as a new tool for discovery and screening in molecular biology with parallelism and sensitivity not possible using any other sensor/detection technology.",KAREN VERGURA,,(781) 391-9002,KVERGURA@NANOSYSINC.COM,CHUNMING NIU,,(617) 669-9180,CNIU@NANOSYSINC.COM,,,,"['selective detection biomolecular marker', 'sensor/detection technology', 'condition', 'applicant', 'real-time', 'nanosensor device', 'fabrication', 'sensitivity', 'technology', 'chemistry', 'nanosensor array', 'project', 'lead detection stage', 'patient', 'in-vivo', 'molecular biology', 'dynamic response device', 'detection', 'Lieber group', 'phase program', 'hand-held device plug-and-play nanosensor platform base', 'parallelism', 'electrical signal response device anthrax maker', 'goal project', 'nanowire field effect', 'protective antigen', 'device', 'in-vitro', 'electrical property semiconductor', 'program']"
