A wideband antenna or a set of antennas are needed to support operation across the entire frequency spectrum of JTRS. To meet this need, Applied EM is proposing an innovative conformal design, which addresses the issues of ultra wide bandwidth, and conformality. The proposed design employs a novel material design to increase the bandwidth of conformal antennas. A unique design that covers the VHF/UHF bands and above (20-2000MHz) is proposed. For this adaptation,  broadband antenna design will be optimized using emerging materials and scaling for a design which satisfies the required size restrictions and satisfies gain, pattern, and return loss requirements. Under the proposed effort, we will develop engineering prototype antennas and validate the design through measurements. A design optimization study will also be conducted for placement of the antenna set on the aircraft. Field measurements are proposed to integrate the antenna with JTR System. Development of these ultra wideband antenna designs will provide for robust antenna systems capable of providing interface not only to JTRS, but also to a wide variety of broadband communication equipment.",C.

U.S. adversaries are continuously improving their acoustic quieting technologies through efforts such as marine machining, energy generation, and propulsion. As a result, adversaries are emitting less acoustic energy than a decade ago and they will emit even less acoustic energy in the coming decade. The Department of the Navy (DoN) has made significant investments improving sensor capabilities. Today’s sensors have higher resolution and more data available to operators and sonar algorithms than ever before. There has been a concerted effort by the Navy to find ways to extract more information from acoustic sensors while reducing operator workload, in order to retain a strategic advantage over adversaries. One means of extracting more information from current sensors is through single- and multi-sensor correlation.

This approach has benefited the development of Air Traffic Control (ATC) over the last century in many ways, including a low-level of required aircraft equipage and the ability to handle contingency situations and adapt to new requirements easily. However, the reliance on voice communication in ATC operations presents challenges to the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs). The remote pilot must interpret each ATC command, direct the aircraft accordingly, and communicate the appropriate response back to ATC.  In this proposed effort, we apply advanced speech recognition concepts to the interpretation of ATC communications to enable autonomous communication between ATC and the Unmanned Aircraft (UA), removing the remote pilot from the communication loop between the UA and ATC.  The key challenge in this approach is to ensure the required level of accuracy and reliability of the ATC speech recognition. To achieve complete autonomy, the UA must also be able to generate and transmit an appropriate response to ATC clearances. Thus, we do not require a speech recognition capability alone, but, rather, we require a fully autonomous command and control capability on-board the UA.  BENEFIT:   A number of potential opportunities exist for the UAACS technology including integration into future UASs, or as a retro-fit into current UAs, as well as application to civilian ATC automation system needs. The UAACS technology has the potential to reduce the workload of the UA remote pilot during airfield ground operations, while allowing mission planning to be conducted more efficiently, insofar as ground operations planning is concerned. In the civilian ATC market, there are many situations in which ATC clearances are only specified by voice command and are not entered into a computer system. In such situations, both ATC computer systems and aircraft-borne computer systems do not have access to the clearance requirements. The Automatic ATC Speech Recognition capabilities could be directly applied to this market need.",Chris Stevenson,Business Manager,(800) 405-8576,stevenson@mosaicatm.com,Chris Brinton,President and Principal A,(703) 737-7637,brinton@mosaicatm.com,,,,"['current', 'paradigm management', 'traffic', 'voice communication', 'Air Traffic Control ( atc ) century', 'low-level', 'aircraft', 'voice communication', 'remote', 'atc command', 'aircraft', 'speech recognition', 'atc communication', 'autonomous communication', 'remote', 'level', 'accuracy', 'reliability', 'speech recognition', 'response', 'clearance', 'speech recognition', 'capability', 'potential', 'technology', 'integration', 'retro-fit current', 'technology', 'mission planning conduct', 'ground operation', 'clearance', 'voice command', 'computer system', 'atc computer system', 'aircraft-borne', 'computer system access', 'clearance requirement', 'automatic', 'Speech recognition', 'capability', 'market']"

This proposal outlines the translational development of a cellular therapeutic already in clinical trials with a novel  regenerative peptide to be used in combination for treatment of spinal cord injury  SCI  and associated dysfunction  Preclinical data from Athersys has demonstrated that acute intravenous administration of bone marrow derived multipotent adult progenitor cells  MAPC  provides immediate and durable neuroprotection after SCI  Benefit to locomotor recovery was seen beginning at one week post injury  as well as significant sparing of white matter tracts  Dr  Silver and his colleagues have identified the glial scar as a significant impediment to long distance regeneration  specifically inhibitory molecules known as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans  CSPGs   After discovering the receptor and signaling pathways associated with this pathway  Dr  Silverandapos s laboratory has developed a novel peptide  Intracellular Sigma Peptide  ISP   which modulates the key receptor in this pathway  In a preclinical study  long term subcutaneous treatment with this peptide initiated in the acute phase following spinal cord injury allowed for delayed recovery of locomotion and bladder behaviors following SCI  Interestingly  while ISP treatment resulted in recovery it had no neuroprotective effects  In the   month time frame of this Phase I project  we propose to combine the use of MAPC with ISP treatment following a translationally relevant rodent model of contusive SCI with the therapeutic aims of i  promoting enhanced neuroprotection  and ii  enhancing sprouting regeneration by altering the response of regenerating axons to inhibitory extracellular matrix  We will evaluate the synergistic effects of treatment by analyzing improvements in motor hind limb recovery  return of coordinated control of the lower urinary tract and quantification of neuronal sprouting regeneration  Dr  Silver and collaborators have been investigating the ability of ISP peptide to induce sympathetic neural regeneration and alleviate arrhythmia following myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury  This data suggests that ISP could also be utilized in other disorders in which CSPGs play a critical inhibitory role  such as traumatic brain injury  multiple sclerosis and stroke  The fact that MAPC has already proven efficacious in preclinical models of acute myocardial infarction  multiple sclerosis  traumatic brain injury and stroke dramatically expands the impact that this combinatorial therapy could have in the field of regenerative medicine  If MAPC and ISP administration can be shown to be effective in ameliorating SCI associated deficits and dysfunction  this therapy could relieve some of the economic burden on the direct and indirect costs associated with SCI related care  and more importantly provide meaningful improvement to SCI patients  Both treatments are non  invasive and systemic  making them highly attractive therapeutic options for

High performance composites are required for air, sea, and land platforms.  One of the drawbacks of these composite systems is the excessive costs and time required for part manufacturing.  Manufacturing of large-scale parts typically require expensive tooling, such as molds, and an excessive learning curve for manufacturing personnel.  These issues are exasperated when a prototype is desired for evaluation or a low number of parts are required.  Part redesign is also problematic, as even slight modifications can require new or refitted tooling.  Often these considerations are enough to limit or bar the use of advanced composite materials, preventing optimal performance or improved capabilities.

SOFC stack, operating at 550oC, is based on novel, anode-supported fuel cells with performance levels higher than traditional, yttria-stabalized zirconia (YSZ)-based fuel cells. Cells arelightweight, and stack design is compact. Rationale for lowering the operating temperature to ~550oC, instead of state-of-the-art 800oC, is based on minimizing amount of fuel required for start-up. Fuel is one of the convenient liquid hydrocarbons with noexternal fuel processing. Required water is added directly to the fuel. The fuel is vaporized and injected directly into the SOFC stack. Essential element of the power module is attainment of thermally self sustaining operation with modest heat loss. Thework proposed consists of (1) Fabrication of novel, high performance single cells.

Reducing vehicle weight is a promising approach and much effort has focused on developing technologies to replace steel. However, exotic materials are proving expensive and often require automotive manufacturers invest heavily in factory retooling. An alternative strategy is to fabricate components from high strength steels so less material is needed for the same loadbearing capacity. This strategy has the advantage of using low cost steel and does not require expensive retooling; however, the high strength steels currently available either required high levels of expensive alloying elements or tend to be brittle and thus unsuitable for automotive applications. Developing lowcost, highstrength, readilyweldable steels with suitable ductility for automotive applications has long been a goal of the steel and automotive industry. SFP Works has developed a novel heat treating process to create lowcost, very highstrength steel. Known as Flash Processing or Flash Bainite, this heat treatment uses a thermal cycle of less than 10 seconds to create a ductile and weldable steel well suited for the automotive industry. Further, Flash Processing requires only a modest investment in new equipment making it attractive for the smallto mid sized businesses that form the bulk of the automotive supplier base. In this proposed effort, SFP Works will enhance their Auto OEM proven methods by developing a Retained Austenite (RA) phase in Flash Bainite. RA has been researched by over 100 prior institutions proving its value in increasing the strength and ductility of steel yet taking many minutes to hours to create. Counterintuitively, the &amp; lt;10s thermal cycle of Flash Processing has already proven meaningful RA volume percentages can be had. Success of this proposal will optimize Flash RA into a 16001900. MPa steel at 2025% elongation; properties highly desired by the Automotive Industry and many others.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Flash Processed steel will provide Americans with lighter more fuel efficient vehicles that also perform as well, or better, in all passenger protection safety tests. Additionally, Flash Processed steels allow lighter military vehicles, farm machinery, line pipe and pressure vessels, and cranes with longer boom lengths and increased lifting capacity, all of which will be lighter and easier to transport yet just as durable.

Robo4 is highly expressed in the retinal endothelium, and activation of this receptor by its endogenous ligand Slit-2 reduces VEG F-induced retinal vascular leak and oxygen induced retinopathy. In other organ systems, activation of Robo4 reduces tissue edema induced by inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies have revealed that Robo4 blocks signaling from VEGF and other cytokines.  Of importance Slit-Robo4 preferentially inactivates VEGF-induced permeability and sprouting without having any direct effects on the ability of VEGF to act as an endothelial proliferation or survival factor. Thus, Robo4 is an endogenous endothelial system  that counterbalances specific downstream pathways of the VEGF receptor. These preliminary studies provide the proof-of-concept that activating the Robo4 receptor will stabilize retinal vessels and prevent pathologic edema and angiogenesis. Specific Aim 1:  Generate recombinant Robo4 peptide agonists. Specific Aim 2: Examine biologic activity of Robo4 peptide agonists Specific Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of Robo4 agonists in murine models of retinal and choroidal vascular disease.

Airviz Inc. is developing an affordable and reliable particle monitor that may be more relevant to adverse health outcomes by measuring both PM0.3 and PM2.5. While measurement of PM2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5µm) is the recognized standard for fine particle air pollution, there is a growing body of evidence to indicate that adverse health outcomes continue at levels less than half the average daily safe values of 12 μg/m3 specified by the EPA. In 2005, Maynard and Kuempel concluded that particle toxicity increases with decreasing particle diameter and increasing total particle surface area, thus challenging mass-based risk evaluation approaches. Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA), 99% of which is due to particles below 300 nm, has been proposed as a better metric to relate PM exposures to adverse health outcomes. Attention has also been paid to relating mass concentrations of ultrafine particles (PM0.1, particles lower than 0.1µm) as a better health metric. But further studies indicate that measuring only ultrafine particles would exclude significant numbers of still very small particles and significant fractions of mass and surface, while measuring the contributions of particles with diameters less than 300 nm would include most, if not all, of these particles. This background suggests that an improved particulate monitor that measures the mass and surface concentrations of both PM2.5 and PM0.3 could provide the most relevant information on the effects of particulate matter on adverse health problems and that such a monitor would include both ultrafine particles and LDSA. Most inexpensive particle monitors currently available in the market use optical scattering techniques to measure particle concentrations and are limited to particles larger than 350 nm. Monitors that can detect particles smaller than 350 nm can become relatively expensive ($7000 to $16,000). The sensor to be developed within this project is an optical sensor that utilizes multiple angles and/or multiple wavelengths, scattering theory and advanced signal processing techniques to infer particle size information. This technology can be used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications or metropolitan environments to provide key insights into air quality and how it can impact human health. Because the monitor will be easy to use and interpret, compared to expensive reference instruments, information can be provided directly to the users so that they can be driven to action. In particular, low-income communities that are often impacted by poor air quality can more affordably determine real-time ambient conditions and drive positive change by using the monitor to identify pollution sources, appropriate mitigation measures, and then track the efficiency of these measures.Project Narrative Recent literature suggests that particle toxicity increases with decreasing particle diameter and increasing total particle surface area. Most inexpensive particle monitors are based upon light scattering and tend to lose sensitivity for particles with diameters less than about 0.3-0.35 µm. The novel particle monitor developed here addresses limitations in current inexpensive particle monitors, to realize a monitor that may be more relevant to adverse health outcomes by measuring both PM0.3 and PM2.5.",SARA LONGO,,(412) 965-9301,sara@airvizinc.com,JILL ANDERSEN,,(412) 651-8688,jill@airvizinc.com,,,,"['abstract', 'particle', 'adverse health outcome measure', 'measurement', 'particle', 'standard', 'particle', 'air pollution', 'grow body', 'health outcome', 'particle', 'particle', 'total particle surface area', 'mass-based risk', 'evaluation approach', 'lung', 'particle', 'metric', 'exposure', 'health outcome', 'particle', 'particle', 'health metric', 'study', 'particle', 'particle', 'particle', 'mass surface', 'information effect', 'particulate matter', 'health problem monitor', 'particle', 'particle', 'market', 'optical scattering technique', 'particle', 'particle', 'detect', 'particle', 'sensor', 'optical sensor', 'wavelength', 'scattering theory advanced', 'signal processing technique', 'particle size', 'information', 'technology', 'industrial', 'metropolitan environment', 'air quality', 'impact', 'health', 'expensive reference instrument', 'information', 'low-income', 'air quality', 'real-time ambient condition', 'pollution', 'mitigation', 'efficiency', 'particle', 'particle', 'total particle surface area', 'particle monitor base light scattering', 'sensitivity', 'particle', 'particle', 'particle', 'adverse health outcome measure']"

The work proposed will improve the resolution of IM-MS by a factor of 20, and the speed by a factor of 400. The data rates that results from these factors goes beyond 4K video rates and will require careful consideration of compression technologies. Should we be successful, it will be possible to measure pieces of SNM in just a few hours and have a map of types of pollen in these pieces. This information would help investigate the source and trail of interdicted SNM pieces and have other applications relevant to national nuclear security. We have requested funds to modify an existing instrument with techniques in development at Robot Nose Corporation. The ultimate outcome is expected to be a new instrument with the above much higher performance that can go into commercial production. With the faster speed and unique separation capability, we expect to find a market with a wide range of applications in materials and biological sample imaging.",JEROME MOORE,,(630) 410-2238,ROBOTNOSE@FASTMAIL.COM,JEROME MOORE,,(630) 410-2238,jerome@robotnose.net,,,,"['mass spectrometry', 'material analysis tool', 'technique', 'ion mobility depend cross section atom', 'molecule cluster mass', 'combination technique', 'ion mobility-mass spectrometry', 'analysis', 'nuclear proliferation', 'instrument technology Ionwerks', 'speed', 'resolution', 'resolution', 'speed factor', 'data rate', 'video rate', 'compression technology', 'map', 'information', 'source', 'application', 'instrument technique', 'outcome', 'instrument', 'performance', 'production', 'fast', 'speed', 'capability', 'market', 'application material', 'biological sample imaging']"

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers high sensitivity to a range of biological processes through the use of targeted radio labeled probes. Unfortunately, precise signal localization can be extremely difficult due to low spatial resolution and the lack of anatomical information. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast, but suffers from poor signal strength leading to low sensitivity. The overall goal of the proposed effort is to combine the best features of PET and MR modalities for small animal studies into a single, very high performance imaging instrument that will record data in both imaging modalities simultaneously. The most obvious benefit of the integrated system will be to provide high-resolution anatomical context for small-animal PET studies. This will lead to better overall understanding of the origin of the PET signals. The 'in-register' MR images can be used to estimate partial volume errors in the lower-resolution PET scans, thus aiding quantification of the PET signal. To achieve these objectives, a high resolution, high sensitivity PET system will be designed and built and will be tested first on a bench, followed by detailed evaluation inside a commercial small animal MR imaging system.",NANCY MARSHALL,,(617) 668-6801,gentine@rmdinc.com,GERALD ENTINE,,(617) 926-1167,GENTINE@RMDINC.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'simultaneous', 'Animal Imaging', 'Abstract', 'biological imaging', 'non-invasive', 'high-resolution', 'high-sensitivity', 'three-dimensional', 'image living system', 'positron emission tomography', 'pet', 'sensitivity', 'biological process', 'target', 'radio labeled probe', 'signal', 'spatial resolution', 'anatomical information', 'magnetic resonance Imaging', 'mri', 'spatial resolution', 'soft tissue', 'poor signal strength', 'sensitivity', 'animal study', 'high performance imaging', 'system', 'high-resolution anatomical context', 'pet', 'signal', ""in-register ' mr image"", 'lower-resolution pet scan', 'quantification pet', 'signal', 'high resolution', 'high sensitivity', 'evaluation', 'mr imaging system']"

When GPS is denied, the drift associated with INS measurements quickly increase measurement errors beyond the point where they are no longer useful for navigation and flight control.

The system uses 2D georectified satellite imagery and 3D terrain information to provide sources of absolute correction for precise localization that are impervious to accumulated drift.  Video imagery acquired from on-board sensors is automatically registered to database imagery via approaches that are robust to variations across sensor collections and sensor types enabling day/night operation, and are refined to provide accurate pixel-based feature correspondences.  Precise localization is then performed based on a rigorous mathematical foundation of imaging geometry coupled with automated refinement that accurately determines sensor and feature positioning in the absence of GPS updates.

The outer layer of the filter will capture soot which will then   oxidize rapidly in the presence of microwave energy, preventing   buildup of soot on the filter surface.  A second layer of the   filter will contain catalysts to promote the reduction of NOx with   JP-8 in oxygen rich atmospheres.  Finally, a third layer in the   filter element will contain an oxidizing catalyst to promote the   complete conversion of CO and VOCs to carbon dioxide and water.

Rivercenter Blvd,Suite 100,Covington,KY,41011-0000,"According to the Joint Commission, approximately 70% of sentinel events in medical care are related to communication mishaps, and despite regular and frequent occurrence, poor communication during patient handoffs (i.e., transfer of patient care information, responsibility, and authority from one provider to another) remains a major contributor to medical errors (Nether, 2017; The Joint Commission, 2017, SEA 58). These estimates are based on the 21,000 health care organizations accredited by the Joint Commission but ignore errors in combat casualty where these numbers are likely to be higher due to the harsh nature of combat environments. Why do patient handoffs matter? Patient handoffs are critical for facilitating and informing decisions about the next level of care and can impact treatment throughout the continuum of care. A standardized approach can help mitigate known risks related to information loss. In addition, the written information transferred during a handoff serves as a patient record. This record informs the patient’s long-term care and determines disability benefits for life. Handoffs are conducted by teams of at least two; and in combat casualty care, there are many known challenges. First, these teams could have little or no previous interactions and may even involve transport teams with no medical background, further complicating communication and coordination of care. Operational experience suggests that context/environment, experience, expertise, and state of the individuals involved in the care of the wounded are among the many factors that could affect successful handoff. These factors impact the way in which information is captured and communicated, which drive the success of the handoff. Imagine a common scenario in recent engagements involving a Marine unit on a foot patrol in Afghanistan—one explosion, then another. This routine procedure of transferring care from one provider to another is fraught with challenges. On the bird, the medic gives the patient more morphine because he appears to be in extreme pain. Unfortunately, the patient immediately deteriorates as his heart slows and blood pressure drops. The patient dies due to a combination of morphine overdose and blood loss. The ultimate goal of this proposed work is to improve combat survivability and reduce preventable deaths by focusing on the challenges that revolve around communication during patient handoffs in combat situations. Products of this work will be a patient handoff protocol based on science and operational requirements and associated training linked to existing Tactical Combat Casualty (TCCC) training.

Preliminary work has shown that very low energy short pulse laser beams can localize microwave energy deposition. Many research questions remain, however, including the efficiency of that energy deposition, the length of time the deposition region remains stable, the potential for simultaneous or sequential multi point energy addition with the extrapolation to the designation of shaped regions for energy addition. During Phase I, Spectral Energies, LLC and Princeton University research team will establish laser pulse energy levels, pulse length and wavelength required for strong microwave coupling and the potential for shaped energy addition. Scaling of the coupling with microwave wavelength will be addressed theoretically based on the laboratory results using the high power sources in the 3 GHz regime. Extrapolation to 94 GHz will be of particular interest due to the availability of high power sources at that frequency and the ability to focus the microwave beam to high intensity due to the short wavelength.

A materials technology development, optimization and evaluation program is proposed, based upon previous proprietary developments by the applicants in the area of cost-effective electro-synthesis of nanocrystalline metals, alloys and composites. The objective is to develop environmentally benign, cost effective, multi-functional nanostructured metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings for specific application to medium caliber weapons.  The proposed program builds upon results from a recently completed DoD SERDP Project PP-1152, “Electroformed Nanocrystalline Coatings: An Advanced Alternative to Hard Chrome Electroplating”, in which cobalt-based nanoscale alloys were developed and demonstrated to meet and/or exceed the performance characteristics of hard chromium.  The proposed program also benefits from two on-going research and development programs: (a) DoD ESTCP Project PP-0411, “Nanocrystalline Cobalt Alloy Plating for Replacement of Hard Chrome and Thin Dense Chrome (TDC) on Internal Surfaces”, in which the nanoscale cobalt alloy coating is being demonstrated and validated at the Naval Aviation Depot in Jacksonville, Florida (NADEP-JAX), and (b) Technology Partnerships Canada: “Environmental Nanostructured Coatings for Aerospace and Defense” which provides R&D support for the development and commercialization of the nanoscale cobalt alloy technology in the Aerospace and Defense sectors.   The proposed program deals with the development of an environmentally benign gun bore coating, which can meet or exceed the performance of hard chrome plating, which will utilize a novel, proprietary high- speed brush plating process which has been specifically developed to cost-effectively deposit nanoscale coatings on the ID surface of gun barrels.  Nanocrystalline Cobalt – refractory metal alloys, and nano-composites containing hard ceramic particles (e.g., boron carbide, diamond, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide etc.) will be investigated.  The program will involve material synthesis and material testing activities; the latter including: microstructure and mechanical property characterization (e.g., sliding and abrasive wear, hardness, ductility, adhesion and thermal cycling resistance etc.).   Promising coating(s) identified in Phase I will be recommended for application to medium caliber gun barrel bores for field testing as part of Phase II activities.   As a result of significant advances already made in related development initiatives (SERDP PP-1152 and ESTCP PP-0411), the program proposed herein is expected to have a high probability of success and is expected to lead to a cost-effective nanocrystalline-based coating technologies providing an environmentally benign coating that meets and/or exceeds the properties of current electroplated chromium coatings for the ID surface of medium caliber gun barrels.

Some of this CO2 is used for merchant applications such as food and beverage and other applications, but a large portion of this captured CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere. This CO2 can be converted into high value chemicals, but the key challenge is to find cheap, carbon-free H2 for this conversion. Therefore, CO2 utilization has been confined to using hydrogen generated primarily by electrolysis from renewable energy like wind or solar, which is still not cheap enough to make most CO2 utilization routes cost-competitive with conventional commercial products. Susteon Inc. is proposing a novel catalytic reactor design with a microporous alumina membrane separating a dehydroaromatization (DHA) reactor from a methanation reactor. The DHA reaction, CH4 = C6H6 + 9H2, converts methane in natural gas into benzene and H2. Currently, efforts to catalytically exploit this reaction are limited by low methane conversion due to thermodynamics (high H2 partial pressure), catalyst coking, and reaction endothermicity. The microporous alumina membrane enables H2 diffusion from the DHA reactor, which will enhance methane conversion, into the methanation reactor, where this H2 is reacted with CO2 to generate more methane. The consumption of the H2 in the methanation reactor maintains an extremely low concentration of H2 optimizing the H2 diffusion rate and methane conversion in the DHA reactor. Because the methanation reaction is also very exothermic, the methanation reactor generates large amounts of heat for the DHA reaction. We also plan to incorporate inhibiting species in the CO2 feed to the methanation reactor that will strategically diffuse back into the DHA reactor significantly reducing the coking reaction. In Phase 1, we plan to experimentally demonstrate increased methane conversion into benzene caused by extraction of hydrogen using microporous alumina membrane and reduced catalyst coking by the controlled counter diffusion of an inhibiting species from the CO2 feed in the DHA reactor along with using H2 and CO2 for demonstrating methanation reaction under these conditions. The anticipated benefits of this novel catalytic reactor and integrated process design enable upgrading methane and CO2 into benzene and other aromatics, with a high profit margin, while effectively utilizing 1.65 tons of CO2 for ton of methane converted. The potential for small-scale modular application of this process also enables installation at remote and/or distributed sites to exploit stranded natural gas reserves or alternatively existing industrial CO2-rich sources while creating American jobs and more effectively utilizing American natural resources.",Raghubir Gupta,,(919) 889-7183,rg@susteon.com,Raghubir Gupta,,(919) 889-7183,rg@susteon.com,,,,"['metric', 'hydrogen', 'co2 use merchant', 'conversion', 'hydrogen', 'electrolysis', 'renewable energy', 'wind', 'solar', 'catalytic reactor', 'gas benzene h2', 'conversion', 'thermodynamic', 'conversion', 'methanation reactor', 'reactor', 'conversion', 'reactor', 'heat dha reaction', 'plan', 'phase 1', 'plan', 'conversion', 'extraction hydrogen use microporous alumina membrane', 'coking control', 'counter diffusion', 'catalytic reactor', 'integrated process', 'high profit margin', 'application process', 'installation remote', 'industrial', 'natural resource']"

Additionally the system will kill odor and allergy causing molds as well as biological agents. The end users will be passenger and cargo railroad lines, local subway and streetcar operators and airports that have internal rail systems. Another market where the product will be useful is the household and commercial building mold remediation. The cleaning of railroad cars is a $250 million market annually. The mold remediation market is $3 billion annually.

Recent advances in integrated circuit technology and the introduction of the PCMCIA bus provide an opportunity to develop tightly integrated, highly mobile, automatic test systems which can be configured by the user for different applications.  The proposed project will study the feasibility of using the PCMCIA bus in the design of automatic test systems.  It will assess all aspects of tester design including reliability, supportability, throughput, mobility, and life cycle cost.  It will also assess the impact of the PCMCIA bus on TPS development and retargeting costs.

This technology enables the use of municipal solid waste (MSW) as a viable, and renewable fuel in coal power plant to commercialization. If successful, existing torrefaction technology can be deployed with the proposed mineral treatment to provide fuel generation at any site near existing waste infrastructure. With the addition of this technology, torrefaction technologies will be able to accept low-cost feedstock and produce cost competitive renewable fuels. This growth in such fuel companies could create many new jobs and the associated economic development. Because of the nature of MSW as an existing fuel source that is generated in all locations, there is potential to boost development around urban and rural areas through job creation, the utilization of renewable power generation, and reduction of society's waste streams. The objectives of this Phase I research project are to remove or significantly reduce the mineral content within torrefied MSW. Torrefaction is a mild thermal treatment that transforms biomass to a fuel similar to coal, and is a proven technology. One major hurdle for torrefaction is the cost of the raw biomass materials. The use of wastes, such as MSW, can make the torrefied biomass (biocoal) cost competitive with fossil coal. MSW, however, contains a large fraction of minerals which cause slagging, fouling, and corrosion in fuel boilers. To overcome this barrier and realize the economic benefits from MSW utilization, Treamin Energy, Inc. has developed a method to remove nearly 100% of soluble and insoluble minerals quickly and inexpensively, and seeks to demonstrate Proof of Concept for the technology. With existing torrefaction and mineral treatment equipment, the process will be demonstrated from mineral, mass, and energy characterizations of the process steams, in addition to using measured process data in economic assessment tools for industrial potential.",Jordan Klinger,,(906) 370-3171,jlklinge@mtu.edu,Jordan Klinger,,(906) 370-3171,jlklinge@mtu.edu,Michigan Technological University,John Diebel,,"['Small Business Technology Transfer phase', 'mineral treatment', 'technology torrefy', 'technology', 'solid waste', 'coal', 'commercialization', 'technology', 'mineral treatment', 'fuel generation', 'infrastructure', 'technology', 'technology', 'low-cost', 'cost', 'economic development', 'source', 'location', 'development', 'rural area', 'power generation', 'reduction', 'phase research project', 'content', 'thermal treatment', 'coal', 'technology', 'cost', 'cost', 'corrosion', 'economic', 'method', 'Concept technology', 'treatment equipment', 'process', 'energy characterization process', 'measure process', 'economic assessment', 'industrial', 'potential']"

This effort extends and builds upon AASC's promising Phase-I results where Ta:W(10%), pure tungsten and Stellite (a cobalt/chrome/tungsten alloy) weredeposited using the CED process. As part of this Phase-II, refractory coatings will be deposited to the inside of 45 mm and 76 mm tests sections using the CED process and live-fire tests will be performed and benchmarked against chrome. The coatings willbe tested for their internal stress, chemical composition, microstructure, hardness and heat-affected zones both before and after the test firings and will be optimized to reduce the chemical, physical and thermal effects to the coating and the underlyingsteel. A full-scale deposition system will be designed and a prototype system will be built to transition the CED process into Phase-III production. To speed commercialization, AASC intends to license the CED technology to a large gun manufacturer. It isanticipated that these coatings will extend the life and increase the capabilities of large-caliber, ship born, naval gun barrels. There are four direct benefits of this Phase-II program. 1) Since the coatings will extend the life of the gun barrels, shipscan stay on mission longer, reducing life-cycle and sustainment costs. 2) The coatings will allow existing guns to be upgraded to use higher energy propellants with a relatively un-intrusive and inexpensive modification to the existing fabrication process.3) The coatings will allow future, high-performance gun system to be built that can not be constructed using today's technology. 4) The CED process eliminates the use of electroplated chrome, which is hazardous and is being phased-out. In addition, CEDcoatings have already demonstrated that they extend the life of ethylene cracking tubes used by the petroleum industry for olefin manufacturing. CED coatings have the potential to extend the life of tubes or cylinders where mechanical wear, causticchemicals or elevated temperatures are contributing factors to the failure of the system, leading to cost savings in operation and maintenance.

Opioid dependence is a growing problem in the United States involving both use of legal medications for non-medical uses and illegal drug use. Over 2.4 million Americans are using prescription opioids for non-medical uses, and 400,000 Americans used heroin last year. Although only part of the problem, heroin use is associated with significant medical issues such HIV, and Hepatitis B and C. Currently, these topics are not part of the standard medical school curriculum. However, opioid dependence and treatment with buprenorphine are topics well suited to teaching medical students since explanation of these topics leads to discussion of the role of practicing physicians in substance abuse treatment, raises complicated multi-disciplinary treatment issues, involves understanding complex biological and social basis of addictions, and leads to the discussion of how new treatments are developed and moved into practice. We will complete creation of a suite of six lessons for medical students. Each lesson will utilize a clinical case scenario approach, which will include straightforward clinical scenarios involving patients with issues related to opioid dependence. The modules will include the following information: 1) the scope of the problem with opioid dependence and other substance abuse, 2) the role of the practicing physician in substance abuse treatment, 3) pharmacology of opioids, 4) detection, diagnosis and assessment of opioid dependence, 5) psychiatric and other common comorbidities with substance abuse, and 6) how novel treatments are developed and implemented in practice ('bench to bedside' issues). We will evaluate the suite of modules' effect on attitudes toward substance abuse patients, clinical practice, self-efficacy, and knowledge. A randomized study will compare subjects using the buprenorphine modules to subjects using modules on a topic that does not contain substance abuse information. Clinical practice changes will be measured using interviews with simulated patients who are trained to bring up issues related to opioid use or treatment. After the value of the courses has been scientifically demonstrated, we will work with medical schools throughout the United States that are interested in adding the modules to their curriculum. If successful, the training will expand the capabilities of medical students and prepare them for the challenges they will face as practicing physicians.",MARY METCALF,,(919) 960-8118,,T TANNER,,(919) 960-8118,tanner@clinicaltools.com,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'suite internet base module', 'education skill', 'training', 'treatment', 'opioid addiction', 'non-medical', 'illegal drug use', 'non-medical use', 'american use heroin', 'problem', 'associate significant', 'medical issue', 'treatment', 'medical student', 'multi-disciplinary treatment', 'biological', 'social basis', 'addiction', 'lead discussion', 'treatment', 'practice', 'student', 'clinical scenario', 'module', 'information', 'role practice physician', 'detection', 'diagnosis', 'psychiatric common comorbiditie substance abuse', 'treatment', 'implement practice', 'issue', ""suite module '"", 'effect', 'clinical practice', 'self-efficacy', 'knowledge', 'randomized study', 'buprenorphine module', 'subject', 'module', 'information', 'clinical practice change', 'patient train', 'issue', 'opioid use', 'treatment', 'value course', 'work medical school', 'module', 'training', 'student', 'face practice physician']"

Diablo Boulevard,Unit 198,Lafayette,CA,94549-3815,"To minimize the impact of each distributed solar installation on the grid (and hence, to increase the use of solar everywhere), customers must be able to use a greater percentage of the energy generated by their own solar panels within their own building or facility. Currently, systems within commercial and industrial facilities are poorly adapted to this objective. PV production is often monitored, but that information is seldom used by on-site systems such as building energy controls, lighting controls, storage systems, or any other potentially flexible loads within a facility. In this project, the EE Team will investigate the technical feasibility of creating an extensible, modular simulation model of electrical load flexibility in each major facility subsystem that will maximize local use of locally-generated solar energy. The proposed research fits well with DOE’s stated interest in increasing the penetration of distributed solar everywhere. Accurate modeling of the value of load flexibility will help vendors of lighting controls, building controls, solar arrays, storage systems, and numerous other technologies to identify new opportunities to offset solar variability and increase the adoption of distributed solar. In Phase I, the Extensible Energy (EE) Team will create a prototype simulation model with three primary components: - A “central broker” that will request changes in load from various building subsystems in response to changes in local solar output and total building load - An “energy agent” that will simulate a particular building subsystem (e.g., a lighting controls system, or a bank of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations), and will respond to requests from the central broker by varying loads of that subsystem - A “rules engine” that will evaluate different operating rules for a building using the broker-agent architecture described above. This Phase I prototype will include simple rules for at least four energy agent types: heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) controls, lighting controls, stationary storage (e.g., a single large battery), and EV charging stations. Phase I will test potential methods of interaction between the energy agents and central broker, and will demonstrate simulated balancing of building loads and local solar output at a one-minute level of resolution for one complete day under a variety of conditions. Future phases will extend these results to one year, will include more refined models of each subsystem, and will develop the central broker into a product ready for commercialization. There are excellent immediate and longer-term commercial opportunities for the proposed system. Vendors of building controls, PV systems, energy storage systems (both batteries and thermal storage), smart chargers, and a host of other systems need access to the proposed simulation tool. Access to such a simulator will reduce cost and time to market of key smart building technologies.

There is a need for the development of reliable, uniform insulation materials with low thermal conductivity comparable to existing commercial products that also provide higher strength at temperature and can be inexpensively manufactured to produce near net shape components in form-factors applicable to Navy hypersonic flight vehicles.  Sporian Microsystems has extensively researched and developed advanced ceramic materials for harsh environments, with a particular focus on materials and sensor technologies based on novel, polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) for ultra-high-temperature applications.  However, while prior work has resulted in processes capable of producing highly advanced bulk thermal insulating materials/foams and hot structure components, this technology has not yet been fully optimized to take advantage of several emerging methods to improve material manufacturability and uniformity as well as process flexibility. The long-term objective of this proposed work is to heavily leverage and expand upon prior PDC-based insulating materials development to improve processes and materials that can be used to cost effectively realize lightweight, high-temperature-operable, ceramic structural insulating materials and components for hypersonic aerial vehicles’ TPS.  The Phase I effort will focus on working with technical partners and industry stakeholders to understand system requirements and develop transition roadmaps, evaluating candidate processes for improved manufacturability,  and proof-of-feasibility testing/demonstration.

Nearly $35 billion of these energy costs are associated with powering lighting equipment or removing the heat associated with using the lighting equipment.  Daylighting can reduce lighting and cooling energy consumption and peak demand.  However, for daylighting technologies to succeed, they must be cost-effective and applicable to both new and retrofit construction.  This project encompasses feasibility research and preliminary development work for an inexpensive Mini-Optical Light Self daylighting system for the side lighting of new and retrofit non-residential buildings.  This system relies on internally mounted mini-optical reflector elements which collect, redirect, and diffuse daylight onto a building internal ceiling plane, effectively increasing the size of a building¿s perimeter daylight zones and reducing the need for the operation of electric lighting equipment.  Phase I feasibility research will refine and evaluate the Mini-Optical Light Shelf concept through component and system level design and analysis, optical performance simulation, scale model testing, manufacturing feasibility studies, and annual building energy and demand simulations.  The technical and economic viability of the Mini-Optical Light Shelf will be evaluated in Phase I.  A conceptual prototype design, including material selection, will be defined for Phase II.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The market for an innovative passive optic daylighting side lighting system is new and existing non-residential buildings.  The goal for the innovative Mini-Optical Light Shelf daylighting system is to be as easily applied as normal internal mini-blinds for both new and retrofit construction.  The use of this side lighting technology could significantly reduce the $35 billion spent each year to light non-residential buildings in the United States and also enhance the quality of their visual environment._","Mr. Michael Holtz, AIA ",President,(303) 444-4149,,Mr. Neall Digert MIES ,Staff Engineer,(303) 444-4149,,,,,"['development', 'mini-optical Light Shelf', 'daylighting system', 'CO', 'business Official DOE Grant No. de-fg03', 'non-residential', 'industrial', 'energy cost', 'lighting equipment', 'heat', 'lighting equipment', 'lighting cool energy consumption', 'daylighting', 'technology', 'cost-effective', 'construction', 'development', 'mini-optical Light', 'lighting', 'non-residential', 'system', 'mini-optical reflector element', 'size', 'building¿s perimeter', 'operation', 'mini-optical Light Shelf', 'concept component system', 'optical performance simulation', 'scale model testing', 'manufacturing feasibility study', 'building energy demand simulation', 'technical', 'phase', 'conceptual prototype design', 'material selection', 'phase', 'market', 'optic', 'lighting system', 'non-residential', 'goal', 'innovative mini-optical Light', 'daylighting system', 'construction', 'lighting technology', 'non-residential', 'quality', 'visual environment']"

Targeted resequencing allows regions of interest to be enriched from a genomic DNA sample and sequenced to high depth allowing cost-effective identification of important variants. In combination with next- generation sequencing (NGS), the approach has been exploited to tremendous effect in identifying candidate genes and variants for an array of diseases and traits from cohorts and populations as well as individual clinical samples. However, the short read nature of NGS technologies severely limits its potential to characterize, for example, compound heterozygotes due to the lack of long range connectivity needed for haplotype phasing and structural variants (SV). Those limitations can be overcome with long read data from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Moreover, new targeting methods tailored toward long read sequencing are being developed such that a comprehensive analysis of key regions in an individual’s genome will soon be within reach. However, an integrated software solution that is easy enough for clinical researchers to efficiently use is sorely lacking.The overall goal of this Direct to Phase II proposal is to develop commercial-grade software that produces a comprehensive catalog of annotated haplotype phased variants from clinical sequencing data and presents them to clinical researchers through a single easy-to-use application with both analytical and genome browsing capabilities, GenVision Ultra. The proposal focuses on augmenting our highly extensible XNG assembly pipeline with tools necessary for fully automated detection and annotation of all classes of variants from haplotype phased sequences. Novel adaptions to core XNG components will partition reads matching the reference from those likely representing a SV for parallel processing (Aim 1). Matching reads will be aligned to the reference using XNG while the putative SV-containing reads will be de novo assembled and annotated using our long read assembler (LRA). Reference-based alignments will be phased using a novel Bayesian classifier to produce two haplotype sequences prior to SNV/small indel calling and annotation (Aim 2). Short read polishing of the entire assembly will be available on demand. Complete small variant and SV profiles as well as the underlying assembly data will be accessible to the end user in GenVision Ultra. In addition, the application will have discrete filtering and statistical tools with which to identify genes and/or variants of interest in an individual sample or across a cohort/population (Aim 3). To ensure that the software meets the clinical sequencing market needs, Arkana Laboratories has agreed to provide ONT and Illumina sequence data from highly curated HapMap control samples processed with their kidney disease gene panels. Those real-world data sets together with expert interpretation and feedback by Arkana researchers provide an ideal environment in which to develop an outstanding software solution for this critical market (Aim 4).Long read sequencing technologies can decipher DNA molecules one thousand times longer than “next generation” sequencing machines. This has tremendous implications for clinical sequencing by giving researchers and clinicians access to previously opaque aspects of an individual’s genome.

This development does not target incremental improvements in current state-of-the-art prediction tools (e.g LST, PSE/NPSE, etc.) but it addresses the transition process as a whole in a fully integrated way. The important transition regions are coupled through a closed optimization loop that is used to determine the extent of the transition region based on available input free-stream turbulence levels and acoustic power spectra. The predictions for each regime will be validated against existing and newly generated DNS databases and experimental data. A key advantage of this approach is that it is not limited to simple geometries.

Using the Genetic Algorithm Driven Decision Support System (GADDSS) the instrument user can steer the analysis as well as the instrument in support of the fastest time to solution. GADDSS aims to utilize parallel HPC resources to aide in the molecular structure determination, refinement, and visualization for the TOPAZ and SNAP instruments at the Spallation Neutron Source by providing a conduit for real-time on-the-fly analysis and experiment decision support. The Orbiter platform will provide federated user authentication and facilitate live data streaming, processing, visualization and storage enabling real-time experiment decision support. Orbiter is comprised of modular, scalable, and secure services that provide a solid foundation  for building sophisticated capabilities and user interfaces that can be used to facilitate live data processing and visualization  for a samples molecular structure of while it is still in the beam, allowing  for enhanced experiment control and beam time optimization. We propose that this platform can be extended to other instruments and DOE BES facilities to provide real- time decision support for facility users, and can be made available commercially as a robust experiment data analysis and visualization  application. The primary success of the GADDSS project was the implementation of a robust experiment data process- in, analysis, and decision support workflow demonstrating the feasibility of achieving a real-time analysis and decision support system. We have prototyped automated analysis and optimization tools that facilitate a streamlined point-and-click process of refining molecular structures from experiment data, and we have demonstrated the feasibility enabling access to key facility resources as well as incorporating other community software tools for an enhanced end-user experience. We will continue to aggressively build on the existing prototype an incorporate several additional components and improvements that we have identified.  Automated data analysis and optimization capabilities including detector boundary peak salvage, 1D Time of Flight peak fitting, and new peak integration methods and models are a priority. We will enhance the decision support capabilities of the user interface, and adapt GADDSS to support other instruments at the Spallation Neutron Source and High Flux Isotope Reactor. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The successful development of the proposed Department of Energy GADDSS project will directly benefit US neutron facilities.

Neurogenesis (birth of new neurons) in the adult brain occurs naturally, routinely, and may be functionally important. Inhibition of neurogenesis is thought to be linked to depression and may be the explanation for reduced hippocampal volume seen in patients with major depression. Drugs designed to relieve such inhibition of neurogenesis and to enhance the level of neurogenesis in patients with depression may provide treatment at a structural level and become long-acting, next-generation therapeutics. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether neurogenic activity is critical and sufficient for behavioral efficacy in rodent depression models. By screening small molecule libraries with in vitro and in vivo models of hippocampal neurogenesis, several compounds with in vivo neurogenic activity in mice have been discovered by Neuralstem Inc. Proposed here is a research plan to test these novel neurogenic compounds for efficacy as antidepressants, using in vitro and in vivo models of depression. 3 of the compounds with distinct chemical structures will be tested after chronic oral administration of 4 weeks in 3 mouse models of depression: novelty suppressed feeding, forced swim, and tail suspension tests.

Unlike lower frequency allocations, wide available bandwidths are capable of supporting data-rates in excess of 1Gb/s by using complex modulation schemes. Though such Modems exist for a multitude of standard products found in everyday use, none are capable of being scaled for use at data-rates approaching 10Gb/s and characteristics of mm-Wave channels have not been accommodated in their design. The objective of this project is to establish the feasibility and direct the future development of such a Modem while taking into full account the channel characteristics important in an mm-Wave communications link, by thoroughly modeling the system at a high level of abstraction, then instantiating the digital subsystem with existing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. This would result in a clear radio development path, with the ability to scale. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project center on the improved understanding and utilization of mm-Wave spectrum and the technologies and markets facilitated therefore. With an improved understanding of channel effects and the Digital Signal Processing algorithms, firmware and hardware used to deal with them; work throughout the mm-Wave range is aided. Furthermore, much of the semiconductor technology used in mm-Wave product is in its infancy, so any characterization performed would be of great value in directing future development. As a complete product, the radios using such an advanced Modem would allow fast, cost effective deployment of Carrier and Enterprise Class 10 GB/s wireless data communications anywhere in the world with a minimum of invasive physical disruption. In some networks presently running with 1 GB/s mm-Wave links, scaling to greater data-rates when the existing link has been over-subscribed is facilitated. Other potential applications include use in hyperspectral survey platforms; airborne or space borne.

The physics simulation capability will consist of a set of coupled software tools used to model the response of hypersonic vehicle structures in extreme aero-thermal environments, at both the global level of the full flight vehicle and the local level of critically-loaded vehicle skin panel(s). For both cases, a hypersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code will be integrated with a nonlinear computational structural dynamics (NLCSD) code in a fully coupled, fluid-structure interaction form. At the global vehicle level, the coupled analysis method will simulate the quasi-static deformation of the vehicle to aero-thermal loads along a given trajectory and identify hot-spots and panels exposed to locally extreme aero-acoustic loads. At the local level, it will simulate the time-accurate response of a skin panel subject to extreme environments to predict stresses and the onset of snap-through and/or flutter. The new coupled multiphysics capability will be validated against available test data for panels subjected to hypersonic flight loads. The final deliverable will be a documented methodology which can be accessed by the Air Force and its contractors as a combination commercial and open-source software.  BENEFIT:   A key outcome of the Phase II program will be a quantitative evaluation of structural design based on coupled multiphysics versus current design methods limited to uncoupled/bounding methods. This will allow future designers to identify whether hypersonic structural design is overly conservative or not, when coupled physics are ignored. Applications in the DoD market include the design/development of weight-efficient military hypersonic vehicles, scram jet and related propulsion systems for hypersonic vehicles, and stealth aircraft with ducted exhaust.

Agriculture is a significant user of ground and surface water in the United States, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the Nation&#39;s consumptive water use and over 90 percent in many Western States. Seasonal snow provides 50-80% of the available water in the Western U.S., but is poorly resolved with a sparse network of sites that use technology that has not changed in over 40 years. Snow researchers have used microwave radar since 1979 and proven its great advantages for snow measurement, however commercially available radar systems are not suited to continuous monitoring of snow due to design and power requirements. Commercially available radar sensors used for snow are designed for short surveys, require an experienced user, and manual input. Post-processing is required, with limited information in near-realtime. Current system cost prohibit widespread use.Technical hurdles: The proposed R&amp;D in this SBIR project will address what we feel is our final technical hurdle; resolving SWE in late season wet snow conditions. For the past several years, our research has focused on penetrating deep into the snow pack to detect the underlying ground and developing SWE related algorithms. These efforts resulted in reliable and accurate SWE measurements in the early to mid season dry snow conditions. A typical season can begin in October and end in late May to early June; we have produced accurate SWE values through the middle of March, or roughly 75% of the season. Through this past research we have concluded that an accurate measurement to the surface of the snow pack is critical in resolving the last inaccuracies related to late season wet snow conditions. This Phase I research will focus on accurate ranging to the snow surface by incorporating an additional higher frequency UWB low powered radar sensor. The new range data will be integrated into our existing SWE algorithms to improve the automated detection of the snow surface, and to allow analysis of frequency-dependent attenuation to allow SWE inversion in wet snow. Goals: Resolve the inability to accurately determine SWE in late season wet snow conditions. The result will be a sensing solution capable of estimating and monitoring the critical state variables of the snowpack (depth, SWE, density, liquid water content) autonomously in real-time. The goal is to be well positioned for a Phase II award where we can begin the prototyping and commercialization of our SWE sensor.Summary of plan: A new K/W-band radar will be integrated with the current snow radar design. Prototype multi-band radar systems will be installed at two locations that are coincident with standard snow observations. Automated processing will be improved and uncertainties in snow estimates defined. Broader/Commercial Impact: The commercialization of a Flat Earth SWE sensor would allow government and private organizations to expand their networks into these critical higher elevations, and cost effectively increase the number of sensors in their networks, improving the accuracy of forecasting for snow related water resources. Sustainable management of water in agriculture is critical to increase agricultural production, ensure water can be shared with other users and maintain the environmental and social benefits of water systems. ?",Douglas Roberts,CEO/Founder Flat Earth Inc,(406) 570-8958,roberts@flatearthinc.com,Douglas Roberts,CEO/Founder Flat Earth Inc,(406) 587-9520,roberts@flatearthinc.com,,,,"['Small Business Innovation', 'Research phase', 'next-generation approach', 'critical water', 'resource', 'agriculture significant', 'user ground', 'consumptive water', 'water western', 'network site', 'technology change', 'microwave radar', 'snow measurement', 'radar system', 'continuous', 'monitoring', 'snow design', 'sensor', 'snow design', 'short survey', 'user', 'manual', 'input', 'post-processing', 'information', 'cost', 'technical hurdle', 'technical hurdle', 'snow condition', 'deep snow', 'detect', 'algorithm', 'measurement', 'snow condition', 'swe value', 'measurement', 'surface', 'snow condition', 'phase research', 'frequency', 'UWB', 'sensor', 'swe algorithm', 'detection', 'analysis', 'frequency-dependent', 'attenuation', 'goal', 'snow condition', 'sensing solution', 'critical state variable', 'density', 'liquid water content', 'autonomously real-time', 'goal positioned phase', 'commercialization', 'sensor', 'k/w-band', 'design', 'multi-band radar system', 'observation', 'broader/commercial impact', 'commercialization flat', 'Earth', 'sensor', 'government', 'private organization', 'network', 'cost', 'sensor', 'network', 'accuracy', 'water resource', 'management', 'agriculture', 'agricultural production', 'water', 'user', 'environmental', 'social', 'water system']"

More than half of Latinos will develop diabetes in their lifetime and are 50% more likely to die from it compared to non-Hispanic whites. Consumption of a high fat diet, insufficient physical activity, and being overweight/obese have all been linked to T2D. Consistent with this, Hispanics are more likely to engage in these risk behaviors and be overweight/obese. Fortunately, a relatively modest reduction in body weight can significantly reduce the risk of developing T2D. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has clearly demonstrated this. Participants who received the DPP reduced their weight by 5-7%. Additionally, several adaptations have been shown to be successful in racial/ethnic populations.However, there remains a gap. Rural Hispanic adults experience even worse diabetes-related health disparities and are less likely to have access to diabetes self-management and support programs compared to their counterparts living in metropolitan counties. Furthermore, rural Hispanic face formidable access and resource barriers. Employing an in-person diabetes prevention program is not sufficient for this at-risk population. However, Latinos have high rates of ownership of smartphones and rural Hispanics utilize the internet from a mobile device at higher rates than both Caucasians and African Americans. Thus, utilizing a mobile, web-based approach is a laudable means of targeting a high-risk community.This will be the first mHealth diabetes prevention program that will simultaneously tailor the DPP for two priority populations: Hispanics and those living in rural communities. This evidence-based and theory driven intervention will provide rural Hispanics with the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy to improve health behaviors and reduce diabetes risk. Users will explore content on healthy eating and physical activity through an array of videos, easy to understand diagrams, and simple navigation features. Users will also receive health text messages to their phones and can access to a live program coach for additional assistance and motivation.In Phase I, a prototype STEPS was developed, which was informed by formative research conducted with 53 rural Hispanic adults across the lifespan. The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention, far exceeding the benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal.During Phase II we will complete development of the STEPS program for rural Hispanic adults. In partnership with Community Action Corporation of South Texas, we will examine the effectiveness of the STEPS intervention to reduce body weight by increasing physical activity and improving overall eating habits. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition or to a control condition.

These markets and the market need for small maneuverable harvesters for research plots and breeder blocks have created a need for an inexpensive, but efficient, camelina harvester. The Seedster has the potential for meeting the demand for a camelina harvester that is inexpensive, variable width, maneuverable, has quick seed unloading and rapid cleanout. In Phase I Native Seedsters, Inc. (NSI) tested the basic Seedster technology which consists of counter-rotating brush and combing drum. The space in-between the brush and comb creates a 'pinch-point' where seed is plucked from the plant inflorescence. The first harvest of camelina with a Seedster resulted in a product that was 50% (by weight) seed, 40% seed capsule halves and 10% stems. In commercial camelina seed production the receiving elevators allows only 4.5% tare. To improve upon the purity of Seedster harvested seed a screening device was designed and tested. This device consisted of semi-cylindrical 9/64"" round-hole screen which housed a 9"" auger. During the second year of the Phase I project the seed purity was improved from 50% to 97% with the addition of the screening device. Although Phase I met or exceeded 4 of the 5 Performance Goals, the seed recovery efficiency was still not high enough to be competitive. In Phase I, the 40"" Test-Bed Seedster capture only 59% of the total seed from stands yielding 1,100 lbs/acre and 70% of the seed in stands yielding 550 lbs/acre. The seed loss was attributed to a) seed shatter upon initial contact with the main brush, b) seed carry over on the combing drum and c) seed that 'stalled out' in the dislodgement chamber and fell back out the pinch-point because of insufficient airflow to carry the seed all the way to the seed hopper. In the Phase I Test-Bed the majority of the airflow for transporting the dislodged seed to the seed hopper was created by the main brush, with supplemental air and direction created by the air assist brush. In Phase I this airflow was insufficient to transport all of the heavy, rounded camelina seed to the seed hopper. In Phase II, a 60"" Test-Bed Seedster will be assembled that is capable of configuration and reconfigurations to address these seed losses. The air-assist brush will be replaced with a tangential flow fan, positioned behind the combing drum to direct and propel all dislodged seed from the dislodgement chamber into the collection hopper, eliminating carry-over on the combing drum. The combing drum will be adjusted forward, thus making the distance between the pinch-point and the point of initial contact closer, reducing initial shatter. Various brush bristle densities and various combing drum surfaces (greater static friction) will be tested for maximizing seed dislodgement. An 8/64"" round-hole screen will be tested in the screening device to try to improve seed purity to 99%. If the Phase II Performance Goals are met the Seedster will be a viable camelina seed harvest alternative for many farmers and researchers.",Maggie Arbuckle,Corporate Secretary/CFO,(406) 294-2995,info@nativeseedsters.com,Lee Arbuckle,President/CEO,(406) 294-2995,info@nativeseedsters.com,,,,"['seed', 'production', 'market', 'market', 'block', 'variable width', 'seed', 'phase native seedster', 'counter-rotating brush comb drum', 'brush comb', ""pinch-point '"", 'seed', 'seed capsule', 'stem', 'seed production', 'elevator', 'seed screen', 'device', 'round-hole screen house 9', 'phase project', 'seed', 'screening device', 'phase', 'performance', 'goal', 'seed', 'recovery', 'efficiency', 'phase', 'seed', 'seed', 'seed loss', 'seed', 'contact main brush', ""comb drum c ) seed ' stall ' dislodgement chamber"", 'seed', 'seed hopper', 'phase test-bed', 'seed', 'main brush', 'brush', 'phase airflow', 'seed', 'seed hopper', 'phase', 'configuration', 'seed loss', 'air-assist brush', 'tangential flow fan', 'seed dislodgement chamber', 'distance pinch-point point', 'brush bristle', 'density combing drum surface', 'static friction', 'seed dislodgement', 'round-hole screen test screen', 'seed', 'phase', 'performance', 'goal', 'seed']"

Many GPCRs display a phenomenon in which different ligands can differentially activate different signaling pathways via the same receptor. It has become clear that single signaling pathway approaches for identifying drug candidates are not adequately suited to detect the full repertoire of compounds that may have other signaling pathway activities beyond the target receptor. One has to examine multiple signaling pathways to link pathway activities to physiologic functions. ERK signaling cascades are important components of GPCR signaling pathways. Both G-protein and ? -arrestin mediated signaling pathways can lead to ERK activation. G-protein activation of ERKs results in the translocation of active ERK to the nucleus,  where it can phosphorylate and activate various transcription factors. In contrast, when ERK is activated via an arrestin-dependent mechanism, active ERKs remain largely in the cytoplasm, where they can phosphorylate non-nuclear substrates. Subcellular locations of phosphorylated ERKs determine downstream signal transduction cascades. Current ERK activation assays are allantibody-based methods. The antibody-based assays measure the phosphorylation status of ERKs using cell lysates, but lack the ability to distinguish G-protein-dependent or arrestin-dependent ERK activation. Critical information on subcellular location anddistribution of activated ERKs, which determine specific signal transduction cascades, is missing. In addition, some of antibody based assay methods are not HTS friendly. Currently, pathway- specific ERK activation assays with the HTS capability do not exist. We propose to develop these novel tools by applying newly developed cell-based protein-protein interaction LinkLight assay technology. The assays can measure specific subcellular ERK activation signaling pathways. ERK signaling pathways are implicatedin LTP, memory, learning, mood stabilization etc. Therefore, developing these tools for identifying compounds modulating pathway-specific ERK activation should facilitate new GPCR drug discovery efforts for treating mental disorders. We propose four aimsfor the project. Aim 1. Develop G-protein-dependent ERK2 activation pathway assay. We plan to utilize phosphorylated ERK2 interaction with imp7 as signal readout for assay development. We plan to validate the assay by using the m-opioid receptor (MOR) andits ligand morphine for nuclear location of the ERK2 activation pathway, since morphine is known to activate G-protein-dependent ERK pathway. Aim 2. Develop arrestin-dependent ERK2 activation pathway assay. We plan to utilize phosphorylated ERK2 interaction with receptor-associated ? -arrestins as signal readout for the assay development. We plan to validate the assay by using the MOR and its ligand etorphine for arrestin-dependent cytoplasmic location of the ERK2 activation pathway, since etophine is knownto activate arrestin-dependent ERK pathway. Aim 3. Generate and characterize D2R ERK pathway-selective activation assay cells. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) include a long (D2L) and a short (D2S) isoforms. We plan to generate stable D2L G-protein- dependentand D2S arrestin-dependent ERK activation assay cells. It is known that D2S activates ERK signaling by an arrestin-dependent pathway and D2L activates ERK signaling by an arrestin-independent pathway. The cells will be used in aim 4 for assessing D2R compounds on ERK pathway activities and for assessing HTS feasibility. Aim 4. Assessing D2R compounds on specific ERK pathway activities and assessing HTS feasibility by conducting a small pilot screening. Brain-derived dopamine D2 receptor-regulated behaviorshave been associated to ERK activation. However, it is largely unknown D2R compounds on ERK activation especially specific ERK activation cascades. We plan to profile D2R compounds (listed in ref. 44) to look for their ERK pathway-selectivity preferences.Dr. Sam Kongsamut, our consultant for the project, having over 20 years experience in antipsychotic drug discovery programs in pharmaceutical industry will correlate the specific ERK pathway assay potencies with potencies of in vivo studies (animal modelsand clinic data). Pathway-selective compounds could have functional selectivity. We also plan to demonstrate assay feasibility for HTS. Dr. Wei Zheng&#039;s group in NCATS will conduct the pilot screenings using the LOPAC library. Based on the results of the aim 4, we will plan next phase research proposal (phase II) and collaborate with partners for developing new leads for treatment of mental health disorders. Once developed, these cells would be the unique products on the market. We plan to market specific GPCR ERK LinkLight assay cells, provide custom-services for compound profiling and screening, and license ERK pLuc reporter host cells with an annual fee.

Patients are susceptible to seizures (changes in sensation, awareness, or behavior caused by brief electrical disturbances in the brain). Often, the electrical disturbances originate from an ""epileptogenic zone"" in part of the brain, from which the disturbances are propagated to other parts of the brain. Epilepsy affects approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States, over 50 million persons worldwide, and 150,000 to 200,000 new cases occur annually in the U.S. Although most epilepsy patients can control their seizures with the use of antiepileptic drugs, about 20% of patients cannot bring their seizures under control using drug therapy. Many patients with pharmacologically intractable seizures can eliminate their disability largely or completely by neurosurgical intervention, which typically involves resection of tissue in the epileptogenic zone to prevent the spread of electrical disturbances. Candidates for epilepsy surgery are generally evaluated with scalp electroencephalography (EEC) telemetry, and, increasingly, with magnetoencephalography (MEG). We propose to develop computer software that will aid clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of medically intractable epilepsy, using data obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), MEG, and EEG. Our goal is to develop and validate improved methods for the non-invasive localization of the epileptogenic zone through the automated analysis of spike-like electrical activity recorded in the interval between seizures (interictal spikes).

CO2 removal from atmosphere is considered critical for reducing climate change effects; Current CO2 capture is performed using amine-based scrubbing systems via absorption–regeneration technology. However, amine based CO2 removal is energy intensive and not cost-effective. Another challenge with current scrubbers is amine-based corrosion of process equipment and pipes. Therefore, there is a need for alternative solutions for reducing CO2emissions on an industrial scale using cost effective techniques. Activated carbons have been investigated as suitable candidates for CO2 capture. They do not require any moisture removal prior to CO2 absorption, they can absorb CO2 at ambient pressures and are easy to regenerate. Compared to zeolites, which have also been proposed as CO2 absorbed, activated carbonshave advantages such as lower cost, higher hydrophobicity, and ~50% lower energy requirements for regeneration. However, compared to zeolites, activated carbon have lower CO2 absorption capacity, which in turn is dependent on the surface area, pore size distribution, and surface chemistry. The first two properties is inherent to the activated carbon material used. Recently, we have been working on ultra-high surface area carbon powder, where we significantly increase the surface area of powder activated carbon by controlled burning of a polymer substrate material over an elongated period of time. The resultant carbon material consists of stacked graphite sheets; we have demonstrated surface area of >3500 m2/g, compared to 1000 m2/g for commercially activated carbon powder, ~2000 m2/g for specialty activated carbon powder such as Kuraray 50 PF, and ~3000 m2/g for graphite/graphene based powders. Additionally, the pores of the activated carbon possess the right distribution in terms of meso and micropores, which is required for efficient carbon dioxide adsorption. The material is produced via a scalable process, and costs comparable to commercially available specialty activated carbon powder, but much less than graphene/graphite powders. In this Phase 1 proposal, we will evaluate extruded form of ultra high surface are carbon as CO2adsorbent under conditions similar to post-combustion CO2 capture in a fixed-bed adsorption unit. We will test the material for CO2/N2 selectivity, reversible adsorption, cyclability and durability.

Over 640,000 new oral cancer cases were diagnosed worldwide, and only half will live more than 5 years after initial diagnosis. By 2020, the annual worldwide incidence is predicted to increase to over 840,000, a 30% rise, and the annual mortality to increase to nearly 480,000, approximately a 37% increase. Oral cancer has one of the highest suicide rates of all cancers due to permanent physical disabilities resulting from disfiguring surgeries. These include permanent speech impairment, an inability to swallow, and/or the loss of the jawbone due to the surgical removal of the tongue and other oral tissue. The long-term costs associated with the treatment and these disabilities can range from $100,000-$250,000, resulting in oral cancer persisting as one of the most expensive of all cancers to treat. Despite these realities, oral cancer remains underserved and remains on the rise in incidence both within the US and worldwide. Survival in patients with advanced OSCC is driven primarily by locoregional treatment failure/recurrence. To address this need, Privo has developed its lead product, PRV111. It is a nano-engineered patch that can be placed directly onto the tumor. By retaining its cisplatin-chemotherapy nanoparticles local, PRV111has shown to destroy cancer cells in the tumor and regional lymph nodes without any systemic side effects. PRV111’s locoregional treatment can address the treatment needs of over 75% of OC patients at the time of their initial diagnosis. The goal of PRV111 is to reduce tumor recurrence while decreasing the amount of facial disfigurement. PRV111 treatment is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial with promising results. Based on PRV111’s interim data, the FDA has funded the clinical study $2M to support the current clinical study to completion. In this proposal Privo is requesting funds to complete its commercialization of its GMP manufacturing, to expand its patent portfolio and to conduct market research and develop pricing and reimbursement strategies. If funded, Privo has also secured commitments for $3M non-SBIR funds from investors to be used toward PRV111’s commercialization needs if this proposal is awarded. Privo believes that PRV111 treatment aligns closely with the aims of NIDCR in providing a safer, more effective, and less costly treatment for oral cancer patients.",MANIJEH GOLDBERG,,(978) 609-1465,mgoldberg@privotechnologies.com,MANIJEH GOLDBERG,,(978) 609-1465,mgoldberg@privotechnologies.com,,,,"['oral pharyngeal cancer', 'death', 'person', 'oral cancer', 'diagnosis', 'oral cancer', 'suicide rate', 'physical disability', 'disfiguring surgery', 'speech impairment', 'loss jawbone', 'tongue', 'oral tissue', 'long-term', 'cost', 'treatment disability', 'oral cancer', 'cancer', 'oral cancer', 'locoregional treatment', 'lead product', 'nano-engineered patch', 'tumor', 'cancer cell', 'treatment', 'diagnosis', 'tumor recurrence', 'treatment', 'phase 2', 'clinical trial', 'interim datum', 'clinical study', 'proposal Privo', 'commercialization', 'manufacturing', 'patent', 'market', 'pricing', 'Privo secure commitment', 'non-sbir fund investor', 'commercialization', 'proposal award', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'oral cancer']"

The multi-core fiber, with single mode operating wavelengths of 1000nm to 1550nm, enhances emerging RFoF applications and virtually eliminates interference coupling between adjacent RF pathways. Additionally, Fiber Optic (FO) pathways are immune to external Electrical Magnetic Interference (EMI), a constant problem in electrical based RF pathways. Another advantage of RFoF networks is their phase stability. Electrical RF systems require constant attention to maintain phase-coherence due to cable sensitivities, a disadvantyage that RFoF systems do not have.

Invizyne Technologies has developed cell-free enzymatic systems that have the potential to increase the overall efficiency of the conversion process and bring down the cost of renewable products. A Techno Economic Analysis identified the cost of using purified cofactors as a main driver of cost of cell-free bioconversions. Bringing down the cost of cofactors will be a critical improvement that will allow for the widespread adoption of this technology. We will bring down the cost of cofactors by developing an alternative process to incorporate low-cost crude cofactor mixes from microbial waste streams. In phase I we quantified the cofactor pools in industrial strains of yeast and E. coli and demonstrated that they can be effectively integrated into a cell-free enzymatic reaction to make terpenes. In phase II we enriched these lysates in for high concentrations of ATP and used them to produce long chain carotenoid Beta carotene. In phase IIA we plan to continue development on generating ATP from microbial waste and implementing cell free enzymatic pathways to run inside this enriched cofactor lysate. The crude cofactors sourced from industrial E. coli or yeast to produce an initial carotenoid product called astaxanthin. Our end goal is to produce astaxanthin at industrial relevant titers and scales (10g/L at a 10L scale).

These applications are often used in harsh environments including the nuclear, space, and military markets.  These radiation environments magnify the difficulty of designing complex SRAMs due to the fact that ionizing radiation and even a single ionizing particle can generate charge in the semiconductor circuit.  The radiation can drastically alter the performance of the SRAM.  For example, the effects of ionizing radiation on MOS transistors can cause SRAM cells to switch states.  In addition, it can also cause shifts in the threshold voltage, changes in the gain and a marked increase in the leakage currents which significantly affect the periphery circuits.  Silicon Technologies, Inc.  propose to design and  commercialize a high-density, high-performance, Rad Hard Cache RAM technology to serve space markets.

Winchester St.,,Murray,UT,84107,"The evolution of hydraulic fracturing has enabled development of unconventional natural gas resources that previously would not have been economical. The volume of water required for these operations is a major concern. Industry is actively seeking methods to reduce water usage and increase the amount of gas recovered per unit of water used to stimulate the formation. There is substantial evidence that the rate and method of flowback of the fracturing fluid has a significant impact on the amount of water recovered and well productivity.  Proposed Solution: REI proposes to develop a multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and an accompanying reduced order model (ROM) tool to predict flowback of the fracturing fluid from a well over time. The ROM tool will use a database of CFD solutions to provide quick estimates of the flowback rate and the potential impact on future gas production. The ROM will be designed to allow field operators and fracturing service companies to optimize the amount of water injected during stimulation, recover more of the injected water and increase the expected ultimate recovery of the natural gas in the formation.  Phase I Work Plan REI will develop a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the Flowback process using the ANSYS/Fluent commercial CFD code. A database of CFD model solutions for flowback will be generated. A reduced order model (ROM) tool will be created using the database of CFD solutions. The CFD solutions and ROM tool will be benchmarked against field data.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The completed ROM tool will allow field operators and fracturing service companies to (a) optimize the flowback rate and recovery of the fracturing fluid (primarily water) before stimulating a well and (b) history match real flowback data with the model to better understand the geometry properties of the produced fractures. This will result in less water usage per fracturing job, higher recovery rates of water from the well, higher initial production rates and higher ultimate recovery of the resource.

These outages close schools, shut down businesses and impede emergency services, costing the U.S. economy between $18 and $33 billion per year. Efforts to restore power start with the utility’s evaluation teams driving through flooded, icy, blocked, unlit roads to document the extent of storm damage to distribution lines. We propose an alternative method to rapidly assess line damage that will assist utility personnel to safely complete their mission. Evaluators often need access to hard-to-reach and unsafe locations after a storm.  When this happens, they can launch an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from their vehicle that will lock onto and follow the distribution lines. The UAV will use stereoscopic 3D depth perception to sense and avoid obstacles as it maintains a fixed distance from the overhead lines, collecting images as it travels the lines. Onboard algorithms will send a curated set of geo-tagged imagery to the Outage Management System (OMS). Other first responders can also be notified of unsafe conditions.

We will analyze their geometry and flag anomalies that indicate structural damage, such as broken elements, downed lines or encroaching vegetation. In Phase  II, we will detect more elements such as damaged pin-insulators, broken ties and blown fuses. We will also deploy our technology on the UAV and integrate with the OMS.

It can also react chemically with the residual steam present in the core to release hydrogen, forming a potentially explosive mixture that can challenge containment integrity. Accident-tolerant fuel attempts to prevent these effects by replacing the zirconium-alloy fuel rod cladding with a non-reactive ceramic material such as silicon-carbide (SiC). Currently, the fuel assembly guide tubes are also made from zirconium alloy, so changing their material to SiC will support the accident-tolerant fuel program. During a reactor accident, keeping the control rods and absorber intact helps prevent a re-criticality. This would be of particular benefit if fresh water with no soluble boron has to be introduced into the vessel to cool the core during the post-accident mitigation phase. The control rod cladding is currently stainless steel that could suffer structural failure during accident conditions. Also, the silver-indium- cadmium (Ag-In-Cd) alloy that is the typical absorber material used in PWR control rods has a low melting point. So in a loss of coolant accident during which the control rods could overheat and fail, the potential exists for the absorber to melt and drain out of the core leading to a potential re-criticality. The purpose of this Phase II project is to continue development of the manufacturing processes required for SiC control rods and guide tubes and replacement absorber materials. The results of the Phase I project will be used to refine the design for the control rods and guide tubes. The analyses performed in Phase I will be updated to include test results from Phase I and additional analyses including seismic analyses and absorber swelling will be performed. A full-scale, partial-length fuel assembly and control rod assembly will be fabricated along with the required guide structure to simulate reactor internals. These components will be used to perform SCRAM tests to characterize performance.The need for irradiation tests will be determined and flow tests with the guide tube and control rod will be completed.

Jolla,CA,92037-4614,Abstract Caveolae at the endothelial cells surface can selectively  rapidly  and actively pump targeted antibodies out of the bloodstream and into underlying tissue in vivo  even when they are conjugated to high molecular weight cargo  Based on this exciting recent discovery  we also found that caveolae pumping system enables unprecedented tumor specific targeting and penetration  Taken together  our evidence strongly supports that targeting tumor caveolae is a new strategy providing a portal to deliver therapeutic agents across the vascular endothelial cell barrier and directly into tumors  Caveolae can rapidly pump a targeted antibody with the attached cargo across the endothelial cells to reach concentrations inside solid tumors that greatly exceed maximum concentrations in the blood  In this project we will focus on testing of the therapeutic utility of the antibody  cisplatin CMdextran immunoconjugates to target truncated form of Annexin A  in tumor endothelial caveolae and to effectively penetrate solid tumors  The data will provide proof of principle of our innovative delivery strategy for therapy of lung cancer and moves toward clinical translation by assessing how well caveolae immunotargeting and pumping into tumors can enhance the therapeutic impact of chemotherapy  We will design  synthesize and asses in vivo the efficacy of cisplatin carboxymethyl dextran  CMdextran   AnnA  antibody conjugate to create new tumor caveolae targeted therapeutics for enhanced delivery and efficacy in lung cancer models using our advanced animal models  We hypothesize that by pumping antibodies armed with cisplatin  CMdextran into tumors  caveolae can rapidly and specifically concentrate therapeutic agents inside tumors and enhance tumor destruction with significantly reduced toxicity  The Specific Aims of this project are  Aim     to characterize in vivo delivery of cisplatin immunoconjugates targeting EC caveolae in tumors  and Aim     to assess therapeutic efficacy of the EC caveolae targeting cisplatin immunoconjugates  This project will utilize our new intravital microscopy  IVM  tumor model system in addition to spontaneous mammary tumors from genetically engineered mice  IVM permits direct visualization of targeting and endothelial processing as well as stroma and tumor cell responses  all of which can be quantified to help provide new insights into therapeutic mechanisms in tumors  Targeting caveolae opens a specific gateway across the restrictive vascular endothelial barrier  It can provide means for enhanced delivery much closer to ideal targeting in order to achieve more effective therapies  We have demonstrated that AnnA  is expressed in the vasculature and caveolae of human primary and metastatic lung tumors  Overall  our proposed project could create a paradigm shift away from the passive transvascular delivery that greatly limits drug efficacy in humans  affording the first prototype of caveolae targeted anticancer therapeutics for future translation into the clinic Public Health Relevance Statement Every year more than         new lung cancer cases are reported in the United States and more than         patients will die from this disease  Despite the high incidence and mortality rates  current lung cancer therapies are still relying upon systemically administered chemotherapeutic drugs that reach every organ of the patientandapos s body  Unfortunately  due to the limited permeability of the vascular walls only a small fraction of the intravenously administered dose actually reaches tumors  This requires continuously increasing doses of the chemotherapeutic drugs in order to achieve at least some level of therapeutic efficacy and is often leading to multiple adverse side effects and drastically reduces quality of life of lung cancer patients  Thus  the efficacy of many systemically administered breast cancer therapies is seriously compromised by the significant barriers that inhibit drug delivery  The overall objective of this study is to use our newly discovered mechanism  the caveolae pumping system  in order to provide an effective solution to the cisplatin delivery and toxicity problems for patients with lung cancer  We discovered the unique mechanism for therapeutics to traverse the blood vessel barrier and designed a strategy that could significantly enhance therapeutic effectiveness while decreasing toxicity of anticancer therapeutics  With support of this grant application  we plan to produce antibody cisplatin immunoconjugates  the hitherto unknown drug candidates with high therapeutic efficacies and greatly reduced systemic toxicity  ultimately offering delivery platform for safe  effective lung cancer therapy,L JEAN

Each year, there are 350-500 million clinical cases and greater than one million deaths due to malaria, primarily of children in sub-Saharan Africa.  There is an urgent need for a safe and effective malaria vaccine and the development of such a vaccine is a global health priority.  Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) based vectors are capable of generating robust and protective T cell and antibody responses in anim al models for malaria and other infectious diseases.  Ad5 vectors have induced potent CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and antibody responses in clinical trials for HIV, and are currently being evaluated as a vaccine for malaria. However, the high prevalence of neutra lizing antibodies (NAB) to Ad5 in human populations, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, has the potential to limit the effectiveness of an Ad5- based malaria vaccine. These Ad5-specific NAB recognize determinants in the hypervariable regions (HVR) of the he xon and on the fiber protein of the Ad5 virion. We hypothesize that modification of the determinants of neutralizing antibodies on the Ad5 virion will enhance vaccine-induced immunity by circumventing Ad5 NAB responses. We propose to develop a capsid-modif ied Ad5 malaria vaccine that will induce robust antigen specific-T cell and antibody responses and is not limited by pre-existing Ad5 NAB. We will utilize an optimized pre-erythrocytic stage malaria antigen, PfCSP(-GPI), as the PfCSP antigen is a major tar get of protective immune responses in humans. We will generate adenovectors that have modifications in the Ad5 hexon HVR, and additional vectors with modifications both the hexon HVR and the fiber knob. These vectors will be evaluated for growth, avoidance  of NAB from human sera obtained from volunteers in the US and Africa, and immunogenicity in mice pre-immunized with Ad5 vectors to generate pre-existing Ad5 NAB.

Box 616,"19 Loveton Circle, Hunt Valley Loveton Center",Sparks,MD,-,"Presently, there is an increase need for materials that exhibit strong nonlinear absorption for various military applications. In addition, materials with the following characteristics are desired:  variable band gap, a cut-on wavelength of 0.4 through 1.4 micron, and a linear transmission greater than 98 percent from the visible (0.4 micron) through the NIR/SWIR (0.65 through 3 micron). In Phase I, we investigated Cd1-xMgxTe and Cd1-xMgxSe for their usefulness in optical switching applications. These materials have nonlinear absorption in the wavelength range from visible to NIR, and possibly extending to SWIR. Phase II work will further investigate the growth of IIA/B-VIB ternary materials with a goal of standardizing and optimizing the growth procedures that produce device quality crystals. The major challenges in producing and processing these materials include: the highly reactive and corrosive nature of group II A elements and II A- VI compound melts; the phase diagrams of these II-VI materials are not very well understood, and the purity of commercially available group II A elements is only 99.9% which is not adequate to make semiconductor grade materials. As the end result of this Phase II work, we will be capable of producing material that can be directly used as passive optical switching.  BENEFIT:  Presently, numerous military and commercial systems utilize the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) spectral region for target detection. Unfortunately, a significant amount of spectral information is oftentimes lost because of weather or other environmental conditions. As a result, many systems are utilizing the visible (VIS) to the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions. This has lead to an increase in the need for materials that can provide filtering across multiple broad wavelength regions and have the ability to filter out unwanted information.  The materials proposed in this research can be engineered to meet these requirements.

Neurodegenerative conditions of the brain are among the most expensive, disruptive, and least well-treated human diseases, arguably because they are not well understood, which precludes a rational approach to treatment. Array Tomography is a new method for tissue imaging with resolution in all three dimensions sufficient to resolve individual synapses and with quantitative characterization of multiple (currently 36) molecular constituents, throughout a 1-mm3 sample. What this means is that it is now possible to construct the wiring diagram of a neural circuit, consisting of a few 100 million to a billion synapses with precise description of the molecular constituents. We believe that this kind of information will enable researchers to begin to comprehend the proper function of neural circuits and, importantly, to begin to understand how it is that the various neurodegenerative processes present and progress. As alluring as this prospect is, Array Tomography has been used in relatively few studies following the inaugural publication in 2007 (Micheva and Smith, 2007), due to the complexity of the method and the cost of establishingit in the lab of an individual investigator. The commercial opportunity is to offer Array Tomography as a service to the research community. We believe this is the best way to bring the power of the method to bear on problems in neuroscience, cancer research, and medical diagnostic and therapeutic development. To that end, in this proposal we seek to refine the procedures developed in the Smith laboratory so that it will be possible to offer array tomography as a service to the academic and industrial communities. Specifically, we propose to develop a single-purpose imaging instrument, including control software that will allow a many-fold increase in tissue slice imaging. In addition, we propose to develop an image storage and retrieval system to enhance the commercial use of array tomography.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#039;s and Parkinson&#039;s are becoming more and more prevalent as the population ages. Efforts to develop treatments for these diseases have been hampered by a lack of technologies that provide  big picture  information about how these diseases progress. We propose to develop a technology for high-resolution microscopic analysis of large brain areas to more fully understand the cellular pathologies caused by these diseases so that more effective treatments can be discovered.",JAY TRAUTMAN,,(650) 773-2942,JKTRAUTMAN@GMAIL.COM,JAY TRAUTMAN,,(650) 773-2942,jay@aratome.com,Stub,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'structure function', 'scientific problem', 'neurodegenerative condition', 'disruptive', 'well-treated human disease', 'rational approach', 'treatment', 'array tomography', 'method tissue imaging', 'resolution', 'individual', 'synapsis', 'molecular constituent', 'wiring diagram', 'neural circuit', 'synapsis', 'molecular constituent', 'information', 'function', 'neural circuit', 'neurodegenerative process', 'Array tomography', 'study', 'inaugural publication', 'complexity method', 'cost', 'Array Tomography service', 'power method', 'therapeutic development', 'proposal', 'refine procedure', 'laboratory', 'array tomography service', 'academic industrial', 'single-purpose imaging instrument', 'control software', 'tissue slice imaging', 'image', 'array tomography', 'public', 'health', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'treatment disease', 'technology', 'information disease', 'technology', 'high-resolution microscopic analysis', 'brain area', 'cellular pathology', 'disease', 'treatment']"

Los Gatos Research will develop a novel lab-on-a-chip technology capable of performing real time, in situ measurements of trace mercury and their chemical species with high selectivity and sensitivity.

This will truly be a pressure-sensitive coating: different pressures will bedirectly observed as different colors.  The color variation is due to the effects of interparticle distance on the optical properties of aggregates of closely spaced metal nanoparticles.  The sensor will be a conformal coating which will ultimately bepainted on to the object, or else applied as a wrap-around polymer film.  Triton's technology will allow the pressure measurement range to be engineered to user specifications, addressing 0-20 psi for this study.  In addition to hydrostatic measurements,this system should be sensitive to kHz (or greater) dynamic pressure variations associated with acoustic vibration or turbulent flow.

The overall market for non-destructive testing and inspection was valued at $6.46B in 2015 and is expected to increase to $11.39B by 2022 at a CAGR of 8.3% between 2016 and 2022. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a Magnetic-Pressure-Sensors (MaPS) device, which already demonstrated significant promise for use in generating volumetric images of steel mass loss in exposed post-tension reinforcement tendons in bridges. Rotating the MaPS device around the circumference of the tendon or placing multiple devices around the circumference; can provide a 2D cross-section map of the total internal steel mass distribution. The device has also been tested on corroded steel rods and it was able to react only to the total steel mass as rust (mainly Fe2O3) loses the magnetic property of iron. The innovation here is the combination of a magnet, a pressure sensor between the magnet and the surface of the structure, and a communication device to report the force detected by the pressure sensor. This combination provides a force signal directly correlated to the mass and location of steel inside the inspected structure. The objective of this proposal is to develop a MaPS sensor technology to measure and image steel mass loss in bridge tendons and pipelines. This will be achieved by developing a magnet arrangement for better penetration depth, an activation pattern of distributed magnets, image reconstruction, and mechanical enclosure.",Qussai Marashdeh,,(614) 214-2655,marashdeh@tech4imaging.com,Qussai Marashdeh,,(614) 214-2655,marashdeh@tech4imaging.com,,,,"['Small Business Innovation', 'Research phase', 'nondestructive testing device base magnetic Pressure Sensor Technology', 'steel mass corrosion', 'bridge', 'tendon', 'infrastructure', 'technical level', 'safety', 'bridge', 'bridge report publish', 'non-destructive testing', 'application', 'real-time fast imaging', 'speed', 'light-weight', 'battery', 'size', 'shape', 'multiple field', 'market', 'non-destructive testing inspection', 'development', 'magnetic-pressure-sensor ( maps ) device', 'image steel mass loss', 'post-tension reinforcement tendon', 'bridge', 'rotate maps device circumference tendon', 'cross-section', 'distribution', 'device test', 'corrode steel rod', 'total steel mass rust', 'magnetic property iron', 'pressure sensor magnet surface structure', 'communication device report force', 'detect', 'pressure', 'sensor', 'signal', 'mass location', 'steel', 'structure', 'proposal', 'maps sensor technology measure', 'image steel mass loss bridge tendon pipeline', 'magnet', 'activation pattern', 'magnet', 'image reconstruction', 'mechanical enclosure']"

PSH is a proven, cost-effective technology that is poised for massive expansion throughout the U.S. if the “ΔH challenge” can be solved. The ΔH challenge refers to achieving a suitable difference in hydraulic head height between the upper and lower reservoirs in a PSH system to enable hundreds of megawatts of electricity generation power by turbines located at the lower reservoir. To date, PSH deployment has been constrained to locations throughout the U.S. for which natural topography provides suitable elevation relief between the upper and lower reservoirs.

An unusual polysaccharide has been identified that can be extruded as a biodegradable plastic. Unique properties allow it to replace certain petroleum-based plastics at the same price as other bioplastics. To gain quick acceptance, details of the process developed during the Phase I project will be published. Revenues will be obtained from sales of the polysaccharide. As the volume of polysaccharide sales increases, the price will further decrease. Plastic manufacturers will not need to change equipment; the change will be in the raw materials. Environmental regulations, problems with plastic disposal, and increases in the price of oil are concerns for the $375 billion plastics industry.

As many as one-third of Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) cases can be attributed to environmental surfaces, particularly hospital “high touch” surfaces (e.g., bed rails, machine buttons, equipment). In the US, an estimated 1.7 million HAI occur in hospitals each year, resulting in 99,000 deaths and an estimated $20 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed project will advance the development of a solution offering continuous protection from bacteria, fungi and viruses, as well as food-borne pathogens and even mold. The current disinfecting paradigm relies on killing pathogens daily or less frequently, leaving surfaces vulnerable to new contamination. The proposed antimicrobial coating maintains surface integrity, potentially serving hospitals, long-term care facilities, outpatient centers, and other applications such as home health, food safety, mass transit safety, mold abatement, and schools. The proposed project will investigate the translational utility, efficacy and safety of a spray-on, re-chargeable, re-applicable antimicrobial surface coating. The proposed technology is a spray-on solution that leaves a thin transparent film on a surface. The film is a polymer composed of one monomer adhering to the surface and a second another monomer that stabilizes chlorine. The coating converts the surface into a chlorine battery such that even a commercially available sanitizer leaves the surface covered with chlorine in a form that can last for more than two weeks without toxic effects upon contact. The proposed coating has excellent efficacy against pathogens because it relies on chlorine; it has enjoyed decades of use because of its broad-spectrum efficacy without generating resistance in pathogens. The proposed work is to advance the development of a formulation that includes anti-fouling monomers.

Utilizing a spatial orientation sensor that can track head movement, coupled with state-of-the-art 3-D eye movement recording and analysis methods, the system will analyze eye movement (nystagmus) and spatial orientation of the head, display the data, and provide interpretive guidelines to assist the operator in carrying out complex repositioning maneuvers manually on an exam table. During Phase I we will design a wireless prototype headset combining a head-tracking system with a video nystagmus analysis and monitoring system to display graphically the ongoing spatial orientation of the subject's semicircular canals and indicate which semicircular canal is creating the nystagmus. A decision support system will offer guidance (pictorial, textual) in undertaking diagnostic and treatment maneuvers, and will monitor the precision of the user's maneuvers. We will also validate performance by demonstrating the added value of the HPM System by performing feasibility studies in a small subject cohort (n=15) with positional vertigo. We will validate performance by determining the added value of the HPM System compared to diagnosis and treatment with the best commercially available equipment.      During Phase II, we anticipate that engineering modifications of the headset will be made based upon Phase I findings. Additional systems will be added to the headset, or as peripheral modules, to develop an advanced decision support system.

This degradation is linked to falling brain energy (ATP) levels and an increased reliance on anaerobic energy production from glucose. Ketone bodies are the evolutionary alternative substrate to glucose for brain metabolic requirements; previous studies have shown that the presence of elevated ketone bodies (ketosis) maintains brain ATP levels and reduce cerebral anaerobic glycolysis during hypoxia. Ketosis can be achieved when fasting or following a ketogenic diet; however, these approaches are impractical for military operators in the field. Exogenous ketone ester supplementation allows for rapid (< 30 mins) and significant elevation of blood ketone levels without the need to maintain a diet or fast.HVMN, in collaboration with researchers at IHMC, proposes a study to investigate the effects of consuming an FDA-approved ketone ester food on operationally relevant cognitive performance in the setting of hypoxia.

set responses during speech audiometry and by obtaining subjective hearing measures  Speech audiometry is used in characterizing functional hearing in settings of hearing screening  diagnosis  hearing aid fitting  counseling  aural rehabilitation training  occupational fitness  and research  A typical procedure used with word and sentence tests in background noise is to ask the client patient to repeat back what was just said  i e   give an open set response   Responses are then scored in terms of words or keywords correct incorrect  This method discards potentially diagnostic information in response errors  because noise can reveal systematic phonetic feature or phoneme confusions  and with background babble  intrusions from the babble  Other response patterns attributable to cognitive or memory declines may manifest in the paucity or verbosity of response words  Specific types of phoneme perception errors are thought to be associated with extent and configuration of hearing loss  and different types of noise maskers  i e   energetic and informational maskers  present different types of perceptual problems that vary in severity across individuals  In order to utilize response errors  computational methods are needed to establish their relationships to the stimulus  This is because response errors may incorporate incorrect stimulus to response phoneme substitutions  as well as insertions or deletions of phonemes or words relative to the stimulus  We have developed sequence alignment methods to mine errors during speech audiometry  which we propose to evaluate using our system  Multi Measure SPIN Chart  MMSPIN Chart   MMSPIN chart will be further developed and installed in the George Washington University Speech andamp  Hearing Center  Aim     Audiologists will use the system during QuickSin sentence and NU   word testing with     clients        years of age  who give permission to access their entire clinic records  Aim     Their conventional speech audiometry will be augmented by obtaining subjective hearing accuracy judgments and hearing self efficacy measures  These subjective judgments are designed to expose discrepancies with objective performance and to reveal individual differences in social cognition associated with hearing loss  both of which may account for the large individual differences in performance and intervention outcomes not accounted for by the audiogram  Evaluation of results in Aim   will include developing group and individual profile models comprising objective and subjective clinical data  With our clinician partners  we will develop formats for communicating MMSPIN Chart results to clients  In Aim    we will present results in a public lecture for audiologists and solicit opinions about how our new results may best impact clinical practice  Our approach can deliver more informative and efficient speech audiometry using existing test materials and can pave the way to more sensitive speech audiometry  including tests that are adaptive to specific levels of speech processing difficulty Narrative  The typical approach to speech audiometry is to elicit open set responses that are scored in terms of words keywords correct  discarding information in response errors  This Phase I will establish the feasibility of increasing diagnostic information provided to audiologists by carrying out word  and phoneme level

Aluminum Honeycomb is the targeted material for replacement. The study will address three focus areas: design, manufacturing, and life cycle costs. Current techniqueswill be analyzed to show a manufacturing payoff of carbon foam utilization, especially in bonding operations to proven facesheet materials. Carbon foams developed from bituminous coal at Touchstone Research Laboratory are the basis for this improvementeffort.      The Phase I effort will produce a sample sandwich composite system for evaluation of fabrication feasibility, material property requirements, and manufacturing process cost benefits. Phase II work will examine the replacement of a rocket honeycombcomposite or satellite bus structural system. This effort will produce a prototype component through methods determined in Phase I.  Manufacturing costs will be reduced as panel joining operations, bonding material selection and implementation areimproved. Integration into current systems would be imperceptible.  After being demonstrated in rocket or satellite applications, the structures can be adapted to many other aerospace applications.  The carbon foam composite panel research will result in a lower cost and higher performance structures than those that are currently available, such as aluminum honeycomb cored composite panels. Lower life cycle costs through the introduction of carbonfoam technology will be enabled through reduced operational and maintenance expenditures. The technology will lend itself to improved aerospace composite structures in line with Lean Manufacturing Principles.The proposal directly supports aerospace structures, such as satellite busses, solar panel arrays, rocket structural and control surfaces.

An estimated 40-70,000 American                    cardiovascular patients under age 65 could benefit from a heart transplant each      year, whereas only 2,400 patients actually receive such transplants. These           patients can benefit from the LVAD type devices both as a bridge to transplant       as well as an alternative treatment option. Of the -900 patients who have            received the LVAD system, a growing number are surpassing the three-year-mark        of continuous support with their LVAD device. With such growing number of            people on LVAD, there is a need for a reliable power system that could support       the devices for longer hours without interruption.

All diseases have genetic and/or epigenetic foundations; however only epigenetics can be altered pharmacologically. Thus, epigenetic pathway components are not only excellent epi-therapeutic drug targets, they are also established biomarkers in many acute and chronic diseases. The information stored in 5-methyl-C (mC) is passed down in a heritable and stable fashion; yet, we know that DNA methylation profiles are frequently altered in a number of diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) where differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have been identified in blood that are similarly found in brain. This means an AD specific pathway or mechanism exists that is mediating alterations in the methylome specifically in peripheral leucocytes, brain and presumably other tissues. Over the past 10y the PI has been working on mC revision pathways and has published numerous papers on the topic. Despite convincing evidence for DMRs in peripheral blood of AD patients, the mechanism of mC re-programming in is unknown. We describe new tools to interrogate mC revisions in neurologically derived cell lines. We devised a screen that uses a neutral GFP gene (i.e., one with no selective pressure) to track changes in DNA methylation in a cellular context. Any forward (more DNA methylation) or backward (less methylation) alters gene expression in a permanent fashion. Cytofluorimetry and cell imaging using engineered reporters, quantifies GFP expression as an indirect readout for mC changes. The method was developed as a screen to identify epi-therapeutics and has been used successfully in this capacity. It is cost effective, simple, robust and will detect biological effectors that alter DNA methylation. We call this the ADEE (AD Epigenetic Effector) screen since it detects epigenetic bio-effectors in AD sera that revise DNA methylation patterns. Also, the ADEE screen works in a lineage specific cell context giving high physiological relevance. Most agree that there is an acute need for peripheral blood biomarkers in AD. We demonstrate that small amounts of serum (5µl corresponding to 5%) induced a strong uptick in GFP expression of a heavily methylated reporter gene, revealing the presence of a potent hypomethylating activity in the peripheral blood of AD patients but not in age-match controls. Since ADEEs appear highly active in AD serum, they may represent early tractable biomarkers for early AD onset, disease progression and management. In support of this, epigenome-wide association studies clearly show that changes in DNA methylation are an early antecedent event to clinical manifestation and are tightly associated with AD neuropathology. Archived serum samples (andgt;600) from the GEMS (Gingko biloba Memory Study) will be used to test reliability of the ADEE biomarker. A subset of the patients in the GEM study displayed no cognitive impairment at baseline (at the start of the trial). Over the course of the next 8y in trial, some patients were diagnosed with AD and serum samples were harvested and stored; thus we have sera on the same cohort before and after diagnosis in sufficient numbers to derive high-powered statistical validation regarding positive and negative predictive power of ADEEs. In summary, the ADEE screen is important and well justified for two key reasons: (1) Similar DMRs are found distributed across brain tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes, so we suspected that the ADEE causing (or enabling) the DMRs will be a circulating factor or factors. (2) We developed an innovative cell-based assay proven to test for the presence of ADEE’s. Since we have strong evidence that AD patient serum contains epigenetic effectors, we are uniquely positioned to validate ADEE as a blood biomarker that differentiates AD from normal patients for early detection. We also plan initial characterizations of the ADEEs in order to optimize the test, extend our knowledge of how AD progresses and (as a long term goal) to identify new druggable epigenetic targets. Our specific aims are designed to: 1. Rigorously Test Reliability of ADEE Biomarkers: specificity and selectivity. 2. Optimize, validate and characterize live cell screening operations and assay quality. 3. Carry out validation data analyses in the same patient cohort before and after AD.Project Narrative In this project, we have developed a synthetic genetic circuit that faithfully reports alterations to the human epigenome. Because it works in a cell context, the readouts are highly relevant to human disease. To explore this new concept, we used the platform to show that serum from Alzheimerandapos;s Disease (AD) patients contain epigenetic factors which are useful peripheral biomarkers for the disease. Development and deployment of diagnostic biomarkers for AD is an essential first step in developing curative inroads.",MARK MULLER,,(386) 304-5948,mark@topogen.com,MARK MULLER,,(614) 451-5810,mark@topogen.com,,,,"['dna methylation', 'epigenetic process', 'disease', 'genetic', 'epigenetic foundation', 'epigenetic', 'epigenetic pathway', 'epi-therapeutic drug target', 'acute chronic disease', 'information store', 'Alzheimer disease', 'ad', 'blood', 'brain', 'mechanism', 'brain', 'tissue', 'work mc revision pathway', 'dmr peripheral blood ad', 'mechanism', 're-programming', 'revision', 'cell line', 'selective pressure', 'dna methylation', 'cellular context', 'dna methylation', 'gene expression', 'cytofluorimetry cell imaging', 'gfp expression', 'readout mc change', 'method', 'cost effective', 'simple', 'detect', 'biological effector', 'dna methylation', 'ad epigenetic effector', 'epigenetic', 'gfp expression', 'hypomethylating activity', 'peripheral blood', 'ad onset', 'disease progression', 'management', 'epigenome-wide association study', 'dna methylation', 'event', 'ad neuropathology', 'memory study', 'test reliability adee', 'patient gem study', 'cognitive impairment', 'course 8y trial', 'serum cohort diagnosis', 'brain tissue', 'peripheral blood leukocyte', 'cell-based assay', 'test', 'epigenetic effector', 'blood biomarker', 'plan', 'test', 'long term goal', 'epigenetic target', 'design', 'test reliability ADEE', 'live cell', 'screening operation', 'quality', 'validation datum', 'synthetic genetic circuit', 'cell context', 'human disease', 'platform serum Alzheimerandapos;s Disease', 'epigenetic factor', 'peripheral biomarker disease', 'development']"

Specifically, the hyperspectral imaging techniques adapted for Raman imaging will enable the UVRED system to quickly detect explosives residue on a 4cm^2 area at a distance of >1m. As a result, this system offers scan times of <30s, making it suitable for near-real-time detection of explosive signatures in the field. Benefits of the hyperspectral imaging will ensure that UVRED devices will reliably detect micron-size explosive particles at areal densities as low as 1m/cm^2, while the inherent high spectral resolution (<10cm^-1) will yield excellent chemical specificity and accuracy of detection, thus, directly addressing the Army requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of UVRED by building a compact, benchtop prototype system capable of meeting the detection requirements and reaching TRL-4.

This presents a series problem in the assessment of fetal heart conditions in patients with high- risk cardiac conditions in specific, and in prenatal care management in general. Transvaginal approach for fetal echocardiography has enhanced fetal imaging by allowing better resolution of extremely small fetal anatomy at close range down to about 13 weeks, but cannot precisely measure fetal heart rhythm and conduction disorders. To answer this challenge, pioneering work on fMCG has demonstrated the unique capabilities of SQUID-based fetal MCG system, including QRS and QT interval measurements, accurate beat- to-beat analysis, precise arrhythmia recording, and detailed fetal heart rate trend analysis.  The objective of proposal is to develop atransvaginal SQUID fMCG system for direct recording of fetal cardiac activities at gestational ages younger 15 weeks, and in addition fetal brain electromagnetic activity. This will facilitate early detections of intrauterine clinical condition of fetuseswith life-threatening arrhythmias, acquired heart failure, and structural congenital heart disease. Unlike the conventional fetal MCG system, which is bulky and requires to be installed in a heavy and costly magnetic shielded room, the new system will bedesigned to be compact and light, suitable for use in clinical settings.  In this Phase II work we have identified major technical challenges, and will address them systematically to pave way for smooth transition to human testing in Phase III and to future clinical operations. The Phase I instrument will be modified to incorporate vector measurement and noise cancellation channels. The animal tests will be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the improved Phase I instrument in live objects. In dataanalysis new noise reduction algorithm will be integrated and tested. Results of these studies will guide the design and construction of light weight magnetic shielding that is easily adaptive to OBGYN clinics; vector sensor probe with reference array thatcan accommodate development of fetus at different pregnancy stages; safe and comfortable patient chair and probe gantry to streamline test procedures. A series of tests will be carried out to access risk level in simulated mechanical and cryogenic failures of the probe.  Successful completion of this program will lead to the first-ever diagnostic tool for fetal cardiology that is capable of providing accurate recording from early pregnancy stages. It offers the significant ability to identify fetal arrhythmias and other cardiac disorders. In addition, it will greatly advance scientific knowledge on both fetal heart and brain development, which can lead to better prenatal care and potential treatments for genetic disorders. 1        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:This proposal aims to develop a compact, noninvasive transvaginal SQUID-based magnetocardiography (fMCG) system for unique early monitoring of fetal heart rhythm conditions. The transvaginal placement is the most effective minimally invasive method for optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio in obese patients and in early pregnancy, as has been demonstrated with transvaginal ultrasound. The new instrument will be a world&#039;s first in its capability to reliably characterize the conduction patterns and intrauterine clinical condition of fetuses with life-threatening arrhythmias, acquired heart failure, and structural congenital heart disease. In addition, its impact on the field of fetal Magnetoencephalography (fMEG) could be even greater since intrauterine evaluation of human fetal brain function has so far been impossible. 1",SHI LI,,(858) 550-2750,sli@tristantech.com,DOUGLAS PAULSON,,(858) 550-2700,paulson@tristantech.com,Stub,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'detection', 'problem assessment', 'cardiac condition', 'specific', 'management', 'transvaginal approach fetal echocardiography', 'fetal imaging', 'resolution', 'small fetal anatomy', 'fetal heart rhythm', 'conduction disorder', 'pioneer work', 'capability squid-based fetal mcg', 'system', 'qrs qt interval measurement', 'to-beat analysis', 'arrhythmia', 'recording', 'fetal heart rate', 'proposal', 'atransvaginal squid fmcg system', 'cardiac activity', 'detection', 'clinical condition', 'arrhythmia', 'heart failure', 'structural congenital heart disease', 'system', 'magnetic shield room', 'system', 'compact light', 'phase', 'technical', 'human testing', 'clinical operation', 'phase instrument', 'vector measurement', 'noise cancellation channel', 'animal test', 'phase instrument live object', 'noise reduction', 'construction light', 'magnetic shielding', 'adaptive OBGYN clinic', 'vector sensor probe', 'development', 'fetus', 'pregnancy stage', 'patient chair probe', 'streamline test procedure', 'mechanical cryogenic failure probe', 'completion program', 'first-ever diagnostic tool fetal cardiology', 'pregnancy stage', 'arrhythmia', 'cardiac disorder', 'knowledge fetal', 'treatment', 'genetic disorder', 'public', 'health', 'proposal', 'compact', 'noninvasive transvaginal squid-based magnetocardiography', 'monitoring', 'fetal heart rhythm', 'minimally invasive method', 'signal-to-noise ratio', 'early pregnancy', 'instrument', 'capability', 'clinical condition', 'fetus', 'arrhythmia', 'heart failure', 'structural congenital heart disease', 'impact field fetal Magnetoencephalography', 'evaluation', 'brain function']"

The proposed assay is a biochemiluminescence assay that uses a novel substrate and permits real time determination of neuraminidase activity, which essentially requires only one preparation step - the addition of sample to a master detection mix that contains all necessary reagents for the assay. The proposed efforts include 1) improving substrate synthesis, 2) evaluating the feasibility as a NI and drug susceptibility assay, and 3) determining whether the assay has sufficient sensitivity so that clinical specimens can be directly used for the assay. Two neuraminidase inhibitors - zanamivir and particularly oseltamivir - are the current mainstay of pharmacological intervention during an influenza epidemic and, if happened, a pandemic. Emergence of drug resistant influenza virus variants heightens the concerns about widespread use of these drugs. It is imperative to monitor the emergence of antiviral drug resistant variants. Both cellular and biochemical based assays have been used to determine viral susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors. Cellular assays suffer from a number of drawbacks, including selection of mutations that compensate for neuraminidase inhibitor resistance during cell culture, long assay time, and tedious procedures, which make them less suitable for large scale surveillance programs. In contrast, the biochemical assays directly measure the inhibition of viral neuraminidase activities, thus circumventing many of the problems associated with the cellular assays. However, current biochemical assays are still complicated, take hours to complete, and have significant assay variability. More importantly, they lack sufficient sensitivity to allow drug susceptibility determination directly using clinical specimens (e.g., nasal wash), a much preferred sample type for large scale surveillance programs. Successful development of the proposed assay will allow the use of clinical specimens for drug susceptibility testing - a significant improvement over the currently used assays, which have to use virus isolates that are obtained via the lengthy and cumbersome culture methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Two neuraminidase inhibitors - zanamivir and oseltamivir - are the current mainstay of pharmacological intervention during an influenza epidemic or pandemic. Given the history of emergence of drug resistant influenza virus variants, it is imperative to monitor the emergence of antiviral drug resistant variants, which requires a robust neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay. The proposed efforts are to determine the feasibility of a novel neuraminidase activity assay as an influenza NI assay. Specifically, we will determine if the assay is 1) rapid (5 min preparation time plus 30 min incubation); 2) simple (essentially one step operation); 3) sensitive (equivalent to or better than 25 cycles of real time PCR assay) so that clinical specimens can be directly used for NI assay; 4) reproducible (CVlt15%); and 5) suitable for a 96-well format for large-scale sample detection.",TIANXIN WANG,,(301) 947-0202,wtx@cellexinc.com,XINGXIANG LI,,(301) 947-0202,LIX@CELLEXINC.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'primary goal', 'influenza neuraminidase inhibition drug susceptibility assay', 'substrate', 'neuraminidase activity', 'substrate synthesis', 'drug susceptibility assay', 'sensitivity', 'current', 'influenza epidemic', 'pandemic', 'drug resistant influenza virus', 'drug', 'emergence', 'antiviral drug', 'resistant variant', 'cellular biochemical', 'viral susceptibility', 'procedure', 'scale surveillance program', 'problem', 'sensitivity', 'drug susceptibility', 'determination', 'development', 'drug susceptibility testing', 'significant', 'virus', 'culture method', 'public health', 'current', 'influenza epidemic', 'history', 'drug resistant influenza virus variant', 'emergence', 'antiviral drug', 'resistant variant', 'neuraminidase activity', 'influenza ni assay', 'rapid', 'sensitive']"

Although it is widely accepted that lithium-ion batteries can achieve the performance metrics required for these applications, some technical limitations still must be overcome.  Specifically, improvements in the electrolyte are needed so that lithium metal can be used as the anode.  To achieve this goal, this project will develop a novel, solvent-free polymer that will be chemically stable to metallic lithium.  Also, its lithium ion-channels will make it highly Li+ conductive.  In Phase I, polymer electrolyte materials were produced that had room-temperature conductives as high as 1.6 x10-3 S/cm (with conductives at 40Â¿C above 10-4 S/cm), were stable in contact with lithium metal during reversible cycling tests in Li/electrolyte/Li coin cells, and were mechanically stable over the electric vehicle batteryÂ¿s operating temperature range of -40 to 90Â¿C.  In Phase II polyelectrolyte membranes will be produced, and the ionic conductivity and stability against lithium metal will be evaluated.  A viable process for making the electrolyte material on the size scale needed for commercialization will be developed.  Prototype lithium/electrolyte/LiCoO2 rechargeable batteries will be produced, cycled, and evaluated for electric vehicle applications.

ECM is a technique of choice for manufacturing of compact and highly efficient heat exchangers, bladed disks, and many other components of aerospace engines. However, deployment of ECM techniques for advanced microfabrication is limited by the problem of “stray-current attack”. When the power is turned on, the electric fields are distributed far from the cathode tool enabling the etching of the workpiece beyond the designed region due to electric current lines acting over this zone. This deteriorates the surface quality of the workpiece and is particularly a problem when ECM is employed to machine a thick workpiece. RMD Inc. proposes to address this problem through the application of an insulating coating on the ECM tool. RMD Inc. will explore a novel multilayered “nanolaminate” design for the insulating coatings that will be deposited using the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). These coatings will be relatively thin (~100 nm), have an excellent adherence to the cathode tool, be pin-hole free, tolerate temperature fluctuations, survive high current densities, and be corrosion resistant from ECM electrolytes. The choices of the coating materials within the nanolaminate structure will be uniquely selected to ensure corrosion resistance, insulating properties, excellent bonding, and good thermal expansion coefficient match to the cathode tool substrate.

The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD. This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

Clinical trials have shown that HIV-1 infection cannot be prevented by immunization with monomeric recombinant forms of viral envelope (Env) proteins. However, it is clear that the HIV-1 Env contains epitopes that can induce neutralizing antibodies and that such antibodies can protect primates from infection.     There are several reasons why monomeric gp120 has been ineffective at inducing neutralizing antibodies in previous animal and human studies. The surface-exposed variable sequences surround the CD4 binding site and might restrict B-cell access to this epitope. The gp120 protein carries epitopes such as the V3 loop that are immunogenic but not exposed to antibodies in the native virus Env structure.     Two main hypotheses inform the design of immunogens for HIV-1 vaccines. The first hypothesis focuses on broadly neutralizing epitopes defined by monoclonal antibodies. It is hypothesized that suitable immunogens will expose these epitopes and induce polyclonal antibodies with neutralizing specificities comparable to those of the monoclonals. The second hypothesis suggests that a single broadly cross-reactive neutralizing specificity is not be readily induced and that multiple epitopes must be recognized to inhibit virus infectivity.     Both hypotheses can be tested by the design and creation of Env-based immunogens lacking variable sequences that might be immunodominant and in any case cannot induce broad neutralizing activity. Removal of variable regions while retaining CD4 binding activity might expose this important epitope as well as others that reside in the relative conserved regions of Env. This approach represents an initial step in a recursive process to build upon a concept, or design, of what features an immunogen should possess.     However, experimental testing of a single prototype sequence does not allow a robust evaluation of the concept. An alternative approach, used in this Proposal, is to create sequence variants for a given vaccine concept and to test a number of those variants. In this way, a larger and more significant dataset can be obtained from which to draw conclusions regarding the value of the immunogen design. In this Proposal, we will attempt to overcome some of the limitations of gp120 as an immunogen. We recognize that an immunogen format such as a soluble trimer mimic or a virus-like particle carrying gp120 might ultimately be required for an effective Env-based vaccine.     The specific aims of this Proposal are as follows: (1) incorporate modifications into gp120 and evaluate their effect on ligand binding properties; (2) create combinatorial libraries of gp120 variants and identify those with CD4 binding activity; (3) immunize rabbits with selected gp120 variants and evaluate the neutralizing activity     If the gp120 variants are able to induce neutralizing antibodies, then additional studies will form the basis of a Phase II SBIR proposal.

Aquafeeds represent >50% of the cost of production, and losses due to mortality can be as high as 50% in certain commercial species. A novel feed ingredient that contains immuno-nutritional properties to address these inefficiencies could be considered a game-changer to the industry. Fish are the most resource-efficient sources of animal protein, a healthy source of food for people, and will be one of the ways to address food security. As the surface of the planet is greater than two-thirds ocean, one estimate suggests, if managed properly, just 2% of this vast resource could produce enough food for all of mankind. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative. In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios (FCR) as compared to conventional diets, while at the same time, statistically relevant improvements in survival of carnivorous fish and shrimp. It also was observed that SCP relieved secondary disease complications associated with diets, such as gastro-enteritis. With hundreds of marketable species in aquaculture, and an industry that is just 50 years old, the collective understanding of aquatic animal nutrition is in its infancy. In this project, a carnivorous Seriola species will be used as a model organism to serve as an additional reference point beyond salmon. Targeted components of the SCP will be enhanced (or deleted) to determine the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals' ability to digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs in emerging commercial fish diets has yet to be fully elucidated, and the results of this study may have implications towards lower-cost feed formulations and optimized nutrition.

The latter is the antitumor active, non-neurotoxic metabolite of penclomedine (PEN). PEN was active in clinical trials but possessed significant neurotoxicity and the trial was cancelled. DM-CHOC-PEN was synthesized as a derivative that coul d cross the blood brain barrier and not be toxic. DM-CHOC-PEN produced complete remissions with long term survival (and no weight loss) vs. intracerebrally (IC) implanted gliomas and breast cancer xenograft models in mice. In contrast DM-PEN did not produc e complete responses in the IC models.

This research and development effort is in response to three problems: 1) the shortage of mental health providers available in rural areas , 3) stigma related to seeking mental health services, 3) the need for medical recordkeeping technology that enables improved communication between patients and mental health practitioners. Despite large rural mental health needs, very few rural communities have access to mental health services in their area. Over half of the counties in the United States have no psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers. Rural residents travel much longer distances to obtain health care services. Otherwise, rural communities must pay high costs for mental health professionals to travel to their local clinics. IconoPsych is positioned to be the first company to offer an ""online clinic"" video conference portal for mental health. Several large studies have found telepsychiatry and telecounseling by videoconference equivalent in outcome and patient satisfaction to face-to-face encounters. IconoPsych is pairing the videoconference functionality with an electronic health record, embedding the teleconferencer within the patient's electronic chart. Such a set-up will enable processes that promise to improve quality and efficiency of care, even in the context of traditional face-to-face mental health clinic visits. The patient is able to complete online questionnaires prior to the visit, e.g., from home. Questionnaire answers are formatted for use by the clinician, conveying the patient's history in a comprehensive and accurate fashion. Also, the clinician may post information for online access by the patient, facilitating understanding of the treatment plan and continuity of care. IconoPsych's ""completely portable"" online portal is to be called HomePsych. Although one or both parties are likely to connect from a clinic or community center, the patient and doctor could connect from their respective homes, given a high speed internet connection and web cam is available. If patients are given the option of seeing a psychiatrist from home, the risk of being seen entering a mental clinic is eliminated.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the stand ard therapy but they are expensive the total cost of an ICD implant approaches  50,000 and the United States spends more than  2.2B on these implants annually. ICDs are effective, but not curative up to half of the patients who receive ICDs develop new sit es of VT that are unresponsive to the defibrillator, requiring them to be put on antiarrhythmia drugs at additional cost. And 55,000 ICDs have been recalled in the last few years for design and reliability problems. Thermal ablation therapy is an attractiv e alternative or adjunctive therapy to ICD implantation as it has a success rate of more than 90% for many classes of supraventricular tachycardias, but it has not been successful in treating ischemic VT. It is generally agreed that ablation therapy has be en unsuccessful because it is not capable of treating the large, deep arrhythmogenic foci that cause ischemic VT. We have developed a method capable of doing so using saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation. We treat VT by injecting warm saline into  the tissue simultaneous with RF ablation. The infused saline flows through the extracellular space convecting energy. This increases the effective thermal conductivity of the tissue by a factor of more than 20. We have used our steerable SERF ablation cat heter with a retractable electrode to demonstrate in a canine infarct model that SERF ablation creates thermal lesions large enough to treat VT the lesions are reliably transmural, even in the presence of infarct scars, and multiple lesions can be placed t o provide a line of block. We have also shown that the therapy is safe, that the catheter meets safety and reliability requirements, and that it is biocompatible. We propose to complete the development of our saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation  system for treating ischemic VT. We will complete the design of our system and catheter and validate that they comply with medical safety standards (EN60601-1), biocompatibility (ISO-10993), and validate the sterilization to a sterility assurance level (SA L) of 10-6. We will carry out extensive preclinical survival testing in large-animal infarct models at the Mayo Clinic, Loyola University, The University of Pennsylvania, and the Brigham and Women's Hospital. We will then apply for and obtain an Investigat ional Device Exemption (IDE) to carry out a multi-center clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our development of SERF ablation to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) is relevant to public health in that we are addressing a growing and expensive problem t he implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) that patients receive to treat these potentially fatal arrhythmias are neither curative nor reliable. The United States spends over  2B annually placing ICDs, and half of the patients develop additional VTs  that are unresponsive to their ICD. At minimum the shocks these patients receive severely reduce their quality of life. At worst the patient remains susceptible to sudden cardiac death.

Luna’s team has developed a novel class of polymers that combine high mechanical strength and thermal stability for this application.  These materials will prolong the life span of the wire insulation and thus reduce the number of out-of-service hours due to repair of failed wire insulation.

Applications include systems ranging from small tactical hypersonic missiles, hypersonic intelligence, surveillance &amp; reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, to upper stages for responsive space access launch vehicles.   ACENT Laboratories and teammates ATK, AMA and Kratos Rocket Support Services have a strong history in the area of hypersonic airbreathing flight testing and propose to continue the development a Low Cost Modular Approach to Flight Testing of Hypersonic Systems.  The proposed Phase II effort includes technology demonstrations in several key areas deemed enabling to the reduction of cost and schedule of hypersonic sounding-rocket based flight projects. These include modular/parametric airframe design and rapid manufacture using investment casting, small form-factor electro-hydraulic actuators for control surfaces, and the use of 3D printing technology to simplify packaging of complex highly instrumented payload components.  Risk reduction testing will be carried out to mature these technologies in preparation for flight testing in Phase III.  BENEFIT:  The saleable product resulting from this research will be a low cost marketable test and evaluation capability not readily available for ramjet/scramjet powered vehicles.  The traditional approach to full-scale hypersonic engine development often begins with subscale component development ground tests leading to full-scale engine ground testing prior to full-scale flight-testing.  Moving from subscale to full-scale or ground to flight both incur significant costs. Our modular low cost flight test technique will permit developers of hypersonic propulsion systems to flight test their vehicle and/or engine in sub-scale early in the developmental cycle to assess thrust and operability performance among other things.  In a synergistic application with computational simulations and ground testing, this crucial flight data will provide a clear path to full-scale flight testing and development with reduced risk and cost. In addition, our modular system could allow testing at more than one scale by moving up in booster class to determine any scale effects early in the program.  Our primary target market for this test capability product is the developmental programs for hypersonic airbreathing propulsion systems that have recently started or will be starting.  Expansion of the applicability of the technology beyond hypersonic airbreathing propulsion is a natural extension of this effort.  Many technical areas including aerodynamic decelerators, re-entry vehicles, and other non-propulsion fields will benefit from the results of this modular design architecture and these customers will be actively pursued.",Anthony Castogiovanni,President,(631) 801-2616,anthony.castrogiovanni@acentlabs.com,Randall Voland,Vice President,(757) 218-5561,randy.voland@acentlabs.com,Stub,,,"['ABSTRACT', 'hypersonic weapon system', 'combined cycle engine open door', 'capability warfighter', 'application', 'system', 'hypersonic intelligence', 'surveillance', 'reconnaissance', 'AMA Kratos Rocket support', 'flight testing', 'development', 'cost modular approach flight testing', 'phase', 'technology', 'reduction', 'cost', 'hypersonic sounding-rocket base flight project', 'modular/parametric airframe design', 'rapid manufacture', 'investment', 'cast', 'packaging complex', 'reduction testing', 'technology preparation', 'flight testing', 'saleable product', 'cost', 'evaluation', 'powered vehicle', 'engine', 'development', 'ground test', 'ground testing', 'full-scale flight-testing', 'cost', 'modular low', 'technique', 'developer', 'engine', 'performance', 'ground testing', 'flight datum', 'flight testing', 'cost', 'modular system', 'testing', 'scale effect', 'propulsion system', 'expansion', 'technology', 'technical area', 'aerodynamic decelerator', 're-entry vehicle', 'non-propulsion field', 'modular design', 'architecture', 'customer']"

These devices include direct digital synthesizers and their associated memories, i.e. numerical look up tables for reprogrammable radar parameters, as well as solid-state power amplifiers (SSPA). Since solid-state systems are generally limited to much lower peak powers than their vacuum tube predecessors, they use much higher duty cycles to get equivalent energy on targets.

Atomically Precise Manufacturing will bring considerable benefit to our technology, economy, and standard of living. However, significant technological development will be required before Atomically Precise Manufacturing can be realized as a reliable and efficient manufacturing process. A promising technology that is being used to develop Atomically Precise Manufacturing is Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) based hydrogen depassivation lithography that can make atomically precise patterns on surfaces. However, hydrogen depassivation lithography is in early stages of transitioning from a microscope technology to a lithography technology. Currently a human expert is required to look at images and make some judgement calls about how to complete the patterning process. To get the human out of the loop so that the patterning process can be automated, faster, and more reliable, Artificial Intelligence guided by physics of the system will be developed to provide the required image analysis capabilities. In Phase I, Zyvex Labs will work with applied Artificial Intelligence experts at Oak Ridge National Lab to develop an AI STM image analysis capability that can identify key features on the Si (100) 2X1 H passivated surfaces. This will allow automated assessment of the lithography process as it is being carried out so that conditions may be optimized even in the face of tip variation and surface defects to create atomically precise patterns. The image analysis will also enable error detection and correction processes to approach patterning perfection. Using these capabilities we will develop sophisticated and adaptable automation processes. If successfully developed, Artificial Intelligence guided hydrogen depassivation lithography will initially make small but extremely valuable products like solid state Analog Quantum Simulation devices to better understand quantum physics and help bring the expected amazing range benefits of quantum materials to the general public, and perhaps a little further down the road the spectacular benefits of quantum computation and communication. Even though massively parallel hydrogen depassivation lithography will be developed, it will still have limited throughput capabilities that can be leveraged by using hydrogen depassivation lithography to make nanoimprint or even roll to roll templates that will dramatically reduce the cost of making extremely accurate patterns at the nanoscale and above.

Inc. proposes to develop a piezo-actuated, precision microvalve for metering extremely low flow rates typical of chemical micropropulsion.  Existing microvalves offer no flow regulation and consume several watts due to their electromagnetic coil actuation while the piezo actuator consumes few mW.  For micro and nano spacecraft which have of the order of 10W on-board, power consumption is crucial and low power valves are enabling.  The proposed microvalve will maintain a set-point flow with 100:1 resolution.  An active feedback system using a calibrated orifice will be incorporated thus eliminating actuator hysteresis and thermal drifts.  Derived from highly successful and flight-qualified Busek product, the proposed microvalve will be small, light weight, and specifically designed to accommodate highly viscous green monopropellants.  Other propellants can be accommodated because the valve body is universal requiring only an orifice change to operate with other fluids or broader range.  The entire flow passage is welded offering high pressure rating making it also suitable for on/off service at the exit port of a propellant tank.  In Phase 1 an advanced prototype of the microvalve will be constructed and tested.  An EM model suitable for flight qualification will be developed in Phase 2 and delivered to AFRL.  BENEFITS: The proposed microvalve will enable new micro propulsion systems for micro and nanosats that can not be realized at present because of the absence of suitable low power valves.  Hydrazine has been phasing out from monopropellant space propulsion systems due to its toxicity. However, it is still a primary choice for micro chemical propulsions like ACS.  For green monopropellants such as AF-315 and ADN to evolve into a major role in ACS applications, a suitable feed system is essential.  The proposed microvalve will attract attentions from NASA and U.S. Air Force who have shown great interest in adapting green monopropellants for future ACS thrusters and satellite propulsion.",Judy Budny,Contracts Administrator,(508) 655-5565,judy@busek.com,Michael Tsay,Research Engineer,(508) 655-5565,mtsay@busek.com,,,,"['rate', 'microvalve', 'flow regulation', 'electromagnetic coil', 'on-board', 'power consumption', 'microvalve', 'resolution', 'active feedback system', 'actuator', 'hysteresis', 'Busek product', 'microvalve small', 'light weight', 'design', 'propellant', 'valve body', 'fluid', 'high pressure rating', 'service', 'port propellant tank', 'model', 'flight qualification', 'phase 2 deliver', 'microvalve', 'micro propulsion system', 'hydrazine phase', 'application', 'feed system', 'microvalve', 'satellite']"

The Phase I program is devoted entirely to examining the ability of the material to produce hemostasis and adhere to the tissue. The material will be tested in vitro and in animal experiments, and its performance is to be compared with a commerically available (Europe) fibrin adhesive. In these tests, it will be tested both in its natural form and when encapsulated in polymeric nanospheres. We believe the adhesive must be part of a wound dressing system which will produce hemostatsis and protect the site of injury from contamination.

Such a quantity and rate of payload delivery will require cost-effective and rapid manufacturing of many large Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). IOS proposes to develop a modular system for in-situ bonding and curing of thermoset resin to the spacecraft structure to facilitate automated manufacturing of TPS. This system will be compatible with additive manufacturing techniques, high-temperature thermoset resins, and composite substrates currently in use and under development by NASA, SpaceX, and others. Our system, combing in-line IR gelation of the resin extrudate and in-situ c-staging, will eliminate the need for large ovens or autoclaves. By leveraging advances in out of autoclave curing methods our system will enable curing of additively manufactured high temperature thermoset resin based TPS in-situ. An infrared heat source mounted directly on the print head will rapidly gel the extrudate as it leaves the nozzle, enabling multi-layer printing. Upon completion of the printing process, a modular system of conductive heat blankets, conforming to the surface contours of the structure will control final cure of the thermoset. The system will measure the temperature of the resin and provide feedback control and log thermal history during curing. In-line surface activation with a corona generator will ensure strong bonding to the underlying substrate and at layer interfaces.Validation of the system will be performed by measuring the degree of cure of in-situ cured samples and measurement of bond strength. We anticipate in-situ cured samples to achieve a high degree of cure, char yield, glass transition temperature, and bond strength, comparable to traditionally cured resins.

Half of U.S. copper consumption goes to electrical, heating, and plumbing infrastructure in building construction and energy use for copper production topped 43 trillion BTUs in the early 1990s. Currently the U.S. imports about 1/3 of the 2.6 billion pounds of copper used annually. This opens our economy to impact by geopolitical uncertainties as rapid modernization in China and India strain demand, elevate prices, and create supply uncertainties which will create strong headwinds to the U.S. economy for decades. Sadly, 1/3 of global copper ore cannot be economically utilized and the remaining 2/3 is rapidly running out. This is forcing producers to use lower grade and less accessible ore which drives up processing energy needs so that energy consumption for each pound of copper production is burgeoning. Blue Planet Strategies (BPS) has a patent pending technology allowing efficient and practical strengthening of weak metal laden streams. Applying this new platform technology to copper production remanufactures ore that is currently a waste into a viable production resource and valuable product stream. It also can reduce copper generation energy consumption by up to 50%! Enabling use of this abundant low-grade ore common to US mines will markedly raise domestic copper production while concurrently saving large amounts of energy for each ton of copper produced this way rather than through conventional means.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The BPS solution augments conventional copper heap leaching operations so that they can cost-effectively produce copper from abundant but currently unusable ore. This will greatly extend active mines times to depletion, can double production at existing operations, and provides the key to unlock 1/3 of the global copper reserves. Such BPS-enabled copper production will stabilize domestic copper supplies and prices, create high-paying jobs, and inject significant revenue into local economies while reducing the Nations reliance on copper imports. This solution also reduces copper minings overall carbon footprint and will save tremendous quantities of coal and diesel fuel through the energy savings realized.

The game will consist of a multi-faceted mystery incorporating shorter mysteries in a sequence of episodes. Each episode will require that the player help one or moreneuroscientists solve a compelling problem. Solutions to the problems and puzzles incorporated into each episode will require inquiry of a neuroscience library and evidence-based reasoning facilitated by a patent-pending note-linking system that promotescritical thinking. Solution of the game will require solving the mysteries in the final and all preceding episodes. The episodes will include situations that are interesting to youth and will involve the wide breadth of exciting work that defines modern neuroscience. This includes the new views of brain remodeling or neuroplasticity; how these changes relate to memory as revealed by brain imaging; the role of stem cells in neurogenesis; brain-machine interfaces by which cortical activity can control external events; the role of neuronal death and neurodegeneration; and traditional elements like synaptic function, action potentials, and neurotransmission. These are exciting topics with the potential to motivate youth. Phase I evaluation will be conducted in four, demographically diverse high schools and will be designed to test the hypothesis that a carefully crafted video mystery game can motivate all students to learn about neuroscience regardless of demographics; that it can succeed while requiring substantial reading and reasoning about topics with substantive content; and that it can significantly enhance the interest of players in one or more sub-disciplines of neuroscience. Additionally evidence will be sought as to cognitive and motivational mechanismsresponsible for observed outcomes, e.g. emphasis on content mastery versus game performance. If this motivating but simultaneously educationally serious video game supports our hypothesis, wide deployment could have an impact on interest and understandingof neuroscience and, by extension of the approach, perhaps to science teaching in a broader context. Combining a motivating video game with serious, inquiry-based library searching of content and using the discovered evidence to determine which of alternative hypotheses are supported and which are ruled out is innovative, original and unique. N Sector will be sold to school districts and individual schools through a distributor, and to individuals through the Internet on a subscription  basis with password-protected access.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With its leadership position slipping, the United States of America is facing an educational crisis that demands serious consideration of innovative approaches able to engage and motivate a wide diversityof youth to learn and think critically. N Sector directly addresses this need by creating an innovative, web- based, educational video game that will appeal to the digital native generation, teach the astonishing ways that neuroscientists are uncovering how our brains work, and lead players to become excited about neuroscience and interested in the field. If anticipated outcomes are realized, the approach could be extended to other fields of science and teaching.)",KELEIGH LEE,,(734) 769-0272,kelmlee@notabook.com,ALVIN MIDGLEY,,(734) 769-7269,rmidgley@notabook.com,Stub,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'proposal', 'development', 'evaluation', 'web-based', 'video', 'Sector', 'diversity', 'school', 'student', 'knowledge neuroscience', 'neuroscience career', 'multi-faceted mystery', 'short mystery sequence', 'problem', 'solution problem', 'inquiry neuroscience library', 'evidence-based reasoning', 'patent-pending note-linking system promotescritical thinking', 'solution', 'modern neuroscience', 'brain remodeling', 'memory', 'brain imaging', 'stem cell', 'brain-machine interface', 'cortical activity', 'external event', 'neuronal death', 'element', 'synaptic function', 'action potential', 'phase evaluation conduct', 'school design test', 'hypothesis', 'video', 'student', 'learn', 'neuroscience', 'outcome', 'content', 'performance', 'hypothesis', 'neuroscience', 'extension approach', 'science teaching', 'video', 'inquiry-based library searching', 'hypothesis', 'sector sell', 'school district', 'school distributor', 'internet', 'password-protected access', 'leadership position slip', 'innovative approach', 'sector', 'educational video', 'native generation', 'brain work', 'lead player', 'neuroscience', 'outcome', 'field science', 'teaching']"

The requirements for these magnets can be met by using a novel coil design called the double-helix dipole (DHD).  The double-helix approach offers a solution to the design of these curved magnets that is much more cost effective and reliable than can be obtained using conventional cosine-theta accelerator magnet designs. This project will demonstrate a bent dipole with double-helix coils, designed not only to meet the operating specifications but also to be suitable for use in the high radiation areas of the RIA.  The method employs helical windings on composite or moldable ceramic coil forms, followed by an epoxy vacuum-impregnation process that creates the strong coil structure necessary for high field magnet applications.  In Phase I, the magnetic and mechanical design concept for a radiation-hard bent dipole will be developed.  The method of coil manufacture, involving composite or moldable ceramic tubes with vacuum-impregnation of epoxy, will be demonstrated by fabricating test coil sections that have the approximate cross section of the final magnet.  The impregnation adhesive will be tested by thermally shocking the test coils and then examininng the interior to show that the adhesive does not crack or otherwise degrade.  A demonstration dipole using this technology will be built and tested in Phase II.  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the Applicant:   The bent double-helix magnets should provide an important contribution to accelerator magnet design for the RIA and other applications having similar requirements.  For example, a bent solenoid magnet with superimposed dipole field is required in the cooling channel of a future Muon Collider.

Correlated digital media will guide the user through the dissection. This innovation is in response to an international trend to reduce anatomy education at medical and dental schools, and in response to increasing facility costs and increasing awareness of the hazards of using cadaveric material. Dissectable models are tangible learning assets that replace cadaveric specimens and can offset the reduction in anatomy education in medical institutions; ensuring that medical students receive a solid grounding in the anatomical sciences. The models and adjunct materials can be adapted to other student populations including K-12, post-secondary, graduate education, and continuing medical education. The models are created using additive manufacturing to reduce costs and to allow the accurate representation of internal structure. The models are constructed of materials that mimic the tactile characteristics of the actual tissue and can be dissected, similar to the real specimens, to reveal this internal structure. The efficacy of all of these materials in learning will be assessed to improve the models and media design. The models, when paired with animations, interactive media, dissection guides, and self-assessment materials, will benefit students by maintaining tactile learning experiences in anatomy education. This SBIR Phase I project plans to supplement or replace the tactile experience of gross anatomy dissection with the use of simulated specimens. Success will require technical advances in digital 3D model production using low-cost multihead 3D printing to achieve a scalable production of anatomical and biological models. Custom, low-cost multihead printers will be constructed that can print a specimen in multiple materials that differ in texture or color or are used as support material for the print. Achieving these technical advances will generate strong early branding and distribution advantages as market barriers to possible competitors. Technical challenges will also include the integration of specific learning objectives into the models, achieving a comparable appearance and texture of actual specimens, and maintaining sufficient low-cost for student and institutional use. The proposed models, when paired with animations, interactive media, dissection guides, and self-assessment materials, will benefit students who prefer tactile learning experiences, and will benefit institutions that are turning away from specimen dissection or cannot provide those resources. Pilot studies will help determine best practices in printing, scale of production, the structure of adjunct digital materials, curricular implementation, and marketing in Phase II.

The models informed by this data are useful for predicting both short- and long-term changes to economically important coastal ecosystems. Distributed sensors for dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measurement in coastal marine settings are of particular interest because of the important role DO plays in catalyzing a diversity of environmentally important biogeochemical reactions. However, commercially available DO sensors are not suited for long-term or in situ measurements in marine environments. The overall goal of this research plan is to explore the feasibility of long-term and in situ deployment of DO sensors in a marine environment. In the first phase of this work, a novel DO sensing technology will be coupled with a remote power and data-logging system to explore the feasibility of remote in situ DO measurement. Additionally, long-term DO sensor stability in the challenging marine environment will be characterized. In the second phase of this work the technology will be developed further, leading to the establishment of a cost-effective remote DO sensing array capable of ecosystem-scale measurements at the important coastal/terrestrial interface. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits DO measurements provide critical information for many areas, including water-quality assessment, groundwater contamination modeling, industrial-process control, and the management of fisheries. Improvements in DO sensing technology that improve performance and reduce cost will benefit these areas directly.

However, the conventional FEL efficiency is usually limited to a small fraction of 1% at short wavelengths, which is a significant strain on the light source accessibility and performance. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Technologies and UCLA are developing a novel concept, TESSA (Tapering Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification), which carries the promise to increase FEL efficiency by over an order of magnitude. By applying a high intensity radiation seed and a novel, strong-tapering algorithm, it was shown numerically that TESSA can achieve an energy exchange rate between laser and electron beam of 50 MeV/m, and an overall efficiency as high as 50%. The TESSA concept has only been validated experimentally at 10 µm wavelength, and in this project it will be extend it into the ultra-violet frequency range. During the Phase I, a detailed numerical study of the proposed TESSA experiment will be carried out, including optimization of the photoinjector operating regime, bunch compression dynamics, TESSA seeding, and amplification. The beamline components and subsystems will be designed and optimized, with particular effort placed on the initial design and cost engineering of the tapered helical undulator.

This project advances a novel hardware and software platform to give PwD full control of consumer products, including game consoles, smart home devices, drones, and business and design software. The system builds on a novel end-user development (EUD) architecture which supports applications in accessibility, IoT, gaming, physical therapy, industrial automation, and other domains involving user-controlled electronic systems. The initial application will be for children with cerebral palsy (CP) ages 5-18, but later applications include adults with physical disabilities, and the aging population. This will reduce time and resources needed for PwD to overcome access barriers, thus creating new opportunities for socialization, education, entertainment, employment, and independence.The intellectual merit of this project is to advance a system to support plug-and-play device compatibility, with developer feedback indicating over an order of magnitude improvement on the state-of-the-art (45 times faster) for implementing accessibility use cases. This project will support the research and design of a visual user interface for non-technical users to enable them to easily configure their devices for everyday applications, as well as a visual editor to allow hobbyists and engineers to implement more demanding accessibility use cases, under guidance from user feedback at a school for children with CP in collaboration with clinical and user experience (UX) researchers.

(Dakota) will demonstrate that a simple solid state halogen specific detector can be miniaturized, hardened, and incorporated into a percussion deliverable probe capable of delineating dense non-aqueous phased liquids (DNAPL) in the subsurface in real time. The proposed system will be based on a halogen specific detector capable of detecting the halogenated volatile organic compounds (hVOCs) from which DNAPL is composed. The signals generated by the detector will be captured by a miniaturized charge integrator, developed by Dakota, which will also fit entirely within the confines of the direct push probe. The selected detector and electronics will be mated with a Membrane Interface Probe (MIP) developed by Geoprobe(r) Systems. By placing the detector directly behind the MIP, issues that continue to limit the performance of the standard embodiment of the MIP such as time lag for analytes to reach the detector and overloading problems will be eliminated. This unique combination will make continuous measurements of DNAPL and associated dissolved phase in both the vadose and saturated zones possible for the first time. Proof of concept will be established through laboratory studies designed to demonstrate the detector's specificity to hVOCs, monotonic behavior over a wide concentration range, immunity to changing subsurface conditions, and detector longevity under field conditions. After selecting the best detector and proving its performance in the lab, a fully functional prototype probe will be constructed and operated in a limited field trial. The field trial will demonstrate the system's ability to log DNAPL via percussion driven direct push platforms, providing an unprecedented understanding of DNAPL distribution in the subsurface. Detailed knowledge of DNAPL distribution is the main key to designing effective remediation strategies. The proposed system will provide environmental consultants, engineers, and regulators with the DNAPL distribution information they so desperately need to accomplish their difficult, but not impossible, task of remediating DNAPL sites. The ultimate beneficiaries of the research will be the citizens who rely on a supply of clean, healthy drinking water. For decades, chlorinated solvents have been used for many applications, including dry cleaning and metal degreasing. These solvents are carcinogenic and being denser than water, can travel down into the subsurface, ultimately reaching the groundwater aquifers used for much of the public's water supply. The proposed research will lead to a real time probe that can more accurately map the source term (NAPL) of these solvents in the subsurface, which will allow for faster and more effective cleanup, thereby minimizing the exposure of the public to these compounds.",ROXANE MEIDINGER,,(701) 237-4908,rmeidinger@dakotatechnologies.com,PAUL JARSKI,,(701) 237-4908,PJARSKI@DAKOTATECHNOLOGIES.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'solid state halogen specific detector miniaturize', 'harden', 'non-aqueous phased liquid ( dnapl )', 'real time', 'system base halogen specific detector', 'detect', 'organic compound', 'signal generate detector capture miniaturized charge integrator', 'detector electronic mate Membrane Interface Probe', 'detector', 'issue', 'time lag', 'detector overloading problem', 'detector specificity hvocs', 'monotonic behavior', 'subsurface condition', 'detector longevity field condition', 'performance', 'prototype probe construct', 'field trial', 'system', 'log dnapl', 'distribution', 'knowledge dnapl', 'distribution', 'design', 'system', 'environmental consultant', 'regulator dnapl', 'distribution', 'information', 'task remediate dnapl site', 'drinking water', 'dry cleaning', 'metal degreasing', 'solvent', 'carcinogenic dense water', 'public water', 'map', 'solvent subsurface', 'exposure', 'public compound']"

The essential elements for incorporating AJ capability into GPS receivers are multi-channel RF front end down conversion, analog to digital conversion (ADC), and digital AJ processing.  The goal of this program is to integrate multi-channel RF front-end and Digital AJ processing circuitry onto a single ASIC and interface this device with next generation military GPS receivers.  RBS Technologies has formulated a Phase I effort that will define and assess architectures for the RF front end ASIC subsystem and the AJ digital processing ASIC subsystem that when combined into a single GPS AJ ASIC will be compatible with state of the art L1/L2 GPS modernized SWaP constrained receiver technology; be capable of accepting RF inputs from a 2-element (option of 4-element) CRPA simultaneously at L1 and L2 GPS frequencies, provide at least 30dB of anti-jam protection for up to 2 (option of 3) 24MHz wide Gaussian noise interference sources; successfully pass GPS M-code signals that can be used by modernized GPS receivers for navigation; and consume less than 1 watt.  BENEFIT:  The development of a microelectronic chip implementation for anti-jam GPS processing that will reduce size, weight, and power by a factor of ten has a very large market  for resource constrained military applications, which include handheld systems, unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, and munitions/weapons.  In addition, there is significant potential market for civilian law enforcement and homeland security.

In response to cellular stress or to maintain tissue homeostasis, the apoptotic machinery initiates and carries out a series of biochemical events leading to cell death in the absence of inflammation characteristic of necrosis. Apoptosis is essential to remove damaged or dangerous cells, and defects in apoptosis contribute both to tumorigenesis and resistance to anti-cancerchemotherapeutic regimens. The complexity of the apoptotic response to chemotherapy coupled with functional crosstalk between apoptosis and the cell survival process of autophagy presents a significant challenge in our understanding of the cellular resistance to chemotherapy. To help characterize the cellular response to different classes of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in tumor cells with defects in apoptosis, we propose to develop a set of isogenic human cell lines as discovery tools for characterizing the apoptosis genes involved in chemotherapy resistance. In this Phase I feasibility project, we will prepare and characterize shRNA expressing lentiviruses specific for six human proteins that are key nodes in either the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways (DR4, Caspase-8, PUMA, BAX, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3). These lentiviruses will be used for the development of stable cell lines with specific gene knockdown in both the glioma cell line LN428 and the colon cancer cell line HCT-116, followed by mRNA expression (qRT-PCR) characterization of each of the knockdown cells and single-cell clones. This will be coupled with analysis to validate apoptosis deficiency via protein expression loss, functional analysis of multiple apoptotic and autophagy endpoints and selective response to apoptosis inducing agents (Temozolomide, Camptothecin, staurosporine and Sulindac). The optimum shRNA for each will then inform for the development of cell lines with the specific gene knockdown together with (i) a far-redfluorescent reporter (FP635) for selection, (ii) a luciferase reporter amenable to real-time imaging of apoptosis and (iii) expression of LC3-EGFP for a direct analysis of autophagy induction, linked via T2A sequences in a single gene cassette. These cellswill function as valuable tools for the identification of key apoptotic targets in chemoresistance and the discovery of agents designed to overcome gene-specific defects in apoptosis. In addition, these novel cell lines are designed to be amenable to high-throughput drug testing or analysis using cell-based and xenograft models. The development of such isogenic human cells specific for an additional 100 genes coding for apoptosis proteins will be the topic of the second phase of this proposal.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We describe the creation of isogenic human cell lines as discovery tools for the identification of key apoptotic targets in chemoresistance and the discovery of agents designed to overcome gene-specific defects in apoptosis. In this Phase I project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by developing isogenic LN428 and HCT-116 cell lines functionally deficient in one of six human proteins that are key nodes in either the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways.

manufacturing method is very costly  extremely labor  intensive  and inadequate in implementing new technologies for improving speech recognition and music appreciation  A superior alternative to hand assembly is microfabrication  which is a fully automated  low cost  and high yield manufacturing process that is capable of implementing a variety of innovations  including smaller array size for residual hearing preservation  drug delivery channels for inner ear health and cell regeneration  and strain gauges for improved performance during surgical insertion  Microfabrication is a very promising alternative to hand assembly  but has yet to meet the following requirements for commercialization      substrates must be composed of proven  long term implantable materials  USP class VI       electrode arrays must be compatible with standard surgical insertion techniques      substrate and electrode sites must be able to withstand long term electrical stimulation in the body      the array must be long enough to extend from the tip of the cochlea to the location behind the ear where the electronics are implanted under the skin  and     the array must have electrical wiring that is compatible with the electrical feedthrough pins of the implantable cochlear stimulator  ICS   During Phase I  MEMStim showed that it is feasible to produce a microfabricated cochlear electrode array out of medical grade materials that can meet the commercial requirements            The goal of Phase II will be to produce just such an array as a minimum viable product  MVP  for cochlear implant manufacturers  The MVP will address requirements           and further improve upon the Phase I results of requirement      In order to accomplish the Phase II goal  the following Specific Aims will be accomplished   Aim    produce a full length microfabricated cochlear array with an integrated cable that can be bonded to an implantable cochlear stimulator and complies with electrical  mechanical durability  biocompatibility  and FDA safety requirements specified in communications with cochlear implant manufacturers and  Aim    produce a connector scheme for integrating a microfabricated cochlear electrode to the feedthroughs of an implantable cochlear stimulator  The expected outcome is an array that can be integrated by customers into their cochlear implant systems and pass all handling use safety tests that cochlear implant manufacturers would need to seek approval from the FDA Project Narrative Cochlear implants allow the profoundly deaf to achieve reasonable word recognition in quiet environments  but technological innovations to achieve fuller appreciation of music and speech are severely limited by the shortcomings of current hand assembly manufacturing methods for cochlear electrode arrays  MEMStim LLC will develop a superior alternative to hand assembly  microfabrication  This novel method is a fully automated  low cost  and high yield

The main barriers to using existing modalities in studies of laboratory animals have traditionally been poor spatial resolution, low sensitivity, and high cost.  Although detector technologies have improved significantly in recent years, current state-of-the-art scintillator technology remains the primary performance-limiting factor.  To address these limitations, this project will develop a new scintillator formed by the co-evaporation of rare earth halides onto suitable substrates.  This new scintillator will simultaneously provide high spatial resolution, excellent stopping efficiency, high light output, and fast response at reduced cost.  Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of developing a rare earth halide scintillator using vapor deposition techniques.  To achieve high spatial resolution while maintaining high, x-ray/gamma-ray absorption efficiency, the scintillator will be grown in the form of microcolumnar films.  In addition to providing excellent stoichiometry control, the vapor deposition method will allow large area films to be fabricated in an economical and time-efficient manner.  The performance of the scintillator films thus produced will be evaluated using x-rays/gamma-rays, and compared to the performance of current scintillators.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the Applicant:   The novel scintillator should have widespread use in small-animal/human SPECT/CT imaging systems in particular, and in nuclear medicine systems in general.

In demanding applications, such as munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is advantageous to use components that can provide multi-functionality. A second approach demonstrated was a half cylindrical tube-shape that could be part of or wrapped around the body of the munition.

Effects on tissue viability, structure, barrier function, and inflammatory cytokine release were monitored. Many of the assays gave results which supported one another and increased confidence in the in vitro results. For instance, histological damage and cytokine release paralleled losses in tissue viability. In addition, decreases in barrier function were measured when tissue viability decreased although the data indicated that barrier function was a more sensitive endpoint (i.e. decreases in barrier function occurred at lower concentrations that did not decrease tissue viability). Importantly, the one material which was mildly irritating in the rabbit vaginal irritation test induced significant decreases in tissue viability and barrier function and increased inflammatory mediator release. In addition, an economic analysis showed the in vitro method to be a cost-effective alternative to the currently used rabbit vaginal irritation test methodology. During Phase 2, the utility of the in vitro assay system will be further expanded to predict vaginal irritation following chronic, repeat exposure. Using the endpoints developed in Phase 1, a prediction model will be developed to accurately assess the in vivo vaginal irritation of test materials and formulations. The method will be transferred to outside contract testing labs and a multi-lab GLP validation study will be performed. In addition, the short and long term reproducibility of the assay will be assessed, and a high throughput version of the assay method will be developed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A predictive test system for assessing the vaginal irritation potential of chemicals and formulations will have far reaching application in industries involved in women's care products, microbicide, contraceptives, excipient development, and topical pharmaceutical products. Evaluation of vaginal irritation is important to minimize chemical hazards to millions of women.

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of   death in the U.S. today and of 5.5 million patients admitted to the emergency department  each year experiencing chest pain, only 10-15% are actually experiencing AMI.  However,   60% of patients are admitted to the hospital even though less than 15% have AMI. Furthermore,  of those patients with suspected AMI, the activation state of blood platelets and procoagulant  proteins in the blood is unknown and thus diagnostic criteria of such activation would aid  physicians in designing timely therapy and in fact determining if patients were truly experiencing  a thrombus-related myocardial infarction.

A novel biomass gasification distributed energy resource system is being developed for microgrids as a drop-in replacement for the backup power and baseload typically provided by diesel gensets. This mobile, containerized unit converts locally-sourced woody biomass into electricity, heat, and biochar in community-scale projects. Biochar is a carbon-rich, charcoal-like co-product of the gasification process and is a highly beneficial soil amendment that increases plant yields and soil health and remediates contaminated soil. A related social impact enterprise creates profitable and scalable community-scale carbon sequestration—with local economic and socio-environmental benefits—by disseminating the biomass gasification system’s biochar product to local residents and agriculture. For this Phase I project, the team will develop a design package to deploy a pilot biomass gasification system as part of a zero-carbon microgrid in Yonkers, New York, and integrate it into the community with a group of partners that engages local green waste sources and community gardens and local food-related organizations and businesses for biochar distribution and utilization. The team will design education and outreach initiatives around the biomass gasification system and will engage with local schools and organizations to deploy biochar.

The OlliTM vehicle is intended to be an electric vehicle driven by four in-wheel electric motors that allow for independent actuation and control for increased traction stability and operation efficiency. This electric vehicle shuttle design is novel and presents a promising architecture because of the flexibility in vehicle control, especially as a connected and automated vehicle. With the actuation redundancy and information from environment sensors, other vehicles, and infrastructure, the Olli vehicle is anticipated to increase the operation efficiency up to 20% for the same local driving scenario, compared with to human-drive mode with a centralized powertrain architecture. The objective of this project will be to use the redundant control degrees of freedom enabled by the independent, in-wheel motors and the information obtained from the vehicle connectivity, specifically Vehicle-To-Everything information such as Signal Phase and Timing information from the traffic signals, and Vehicle-To-Vehicle information from surrounding vehicles to optimize the control algorithm for maximum energy efficiency. The Vehicle-To-Vehicle connectivity will include road topography information used in a calculation of upcoming vehicle pitch and roll angles. The maximum vehicle operation efficiency will be achieved by simultaneously realizing the high-level vehicle (speed, acceleration and deceleration, and path selection) efficiency optimization and the component-level motor (torque allocation and distribution) efficiency optimization. The Research Institution partner, Arizona State University, is already developing the connected and automated, electric vehicle that will serve as the testbed for Olli automated driving control strategies. In Phase I of the project, Local Motors and Arizona State University will formulate and develop the joint high- level and low-level optimization problem to be used in for the control algorithm with a goal of maximizing vehicle efficiency. After testing at Local Motors and Arizona State University, the vehicle’s operation will be tested in Anthem, Arizona, a residential area within the Maricopa County Department of Transportation purview – in collaboration with the Maricopa County Department of Transportation. Maricopa County Department of Transportation has equipped several intersections of the Anthem testbed with connectivity equipment that provide Signal Phase and Timing information and has vehicles that can provide the upcoming topography information. The combination of testbed and test area will allow for rapid control strategy development. The intent will be to employ a developed control algorithm in the Olli vehicle by the end of Phase 1 that shows 10% improvement in energy efficiency from the baseline vehicle. If applications for Phase II and III are awarded, the energy efficiency increase achieved through optimization of the vehicle control strategy will allow for a longer range and/or smaller energy storage system that will improve the performance and commercial prospects of the developing Olli shuttle bus. More electric shuttle buses can reduce city congestion and local pollution by providing an alternative to vehicles and can increase mobility for older and disabled citizens. High-occupancy vehicles reduce energy consumption, especially for highly efficient electric vehicles.

However, the development of efficient and cost effective pollution control technologies will be required before coal gasification can be introduced on a commercial scale.  In particular, the removal of sulfur species and trace metals (mercury, arsenic, and selenium) presents a technical and economic challenge. One approach for removing these gas-phase pollutants from gasifier product streams is the use of robust, multi-pollutant sorbents that can be applied at elevated temperature and pressure.  Recently, a new class of sorbent materials, Amended Silicates, has been characterized for the removal of mercury (in both elemental and oxidized forms) in actual power plant flue gas and for capturing arsenic from drinking water.  In this project, these sorbents will be adapted for gasifiers to control sulfur, mercury, arsenic, and selenium trace contaminants.  In Phase I, sorbents with proven abilities to capture mercury, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen selenide, and arsine will be manufactured for laboratory and demonstration purposes.  Tests will be conducted to quantify sorption capacities, using a simulated gasifier fuel gas that replicates the composition of gasifier product.  A sorbent test bed will then be built and used to demonstrate the technology on a slipstream at an operating pilot-scale gasifier.  In Phase II, the sorbent formulation will be optimized for low-cost manufacture.

Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) is not required by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), but is highly recommended. FCT verifies AFSCN ability to command and control a satellite prior to shipment to the launch base.  Current FCT is performed by the Transportable Space Test and Evaluation Resource (TSTR), a system originally designed to function as a replacement AFSCN remote tracking station (RTS)  in the event of an RTS failure or maintenance outage.  The TSTR system is prohibitively large and expensive to ship to satellite factory locations and requires specialized expertise to operate. A compact FCT system, using advanced signal processing technologies and identical in function to AFSCN ground stations, would provide significant benefits to all AFSCN-supported space programs.  Early compatibility issue detection is highly desirable--elimination of these issues at the contractor facility can be accomplished in an efficient manner given on-site availability of satellite-specific engineering expertise and specialized test equipment.  An advanced FCT system could save significant satellite pre-launch test costs and would free up critical AFSCN hardware and personnel.  BENEFIT:  By greatly reducing or eliminating hardware and driving equipment requirements into the digital domain, satellite command and control can be performed from virtually any location with small, highly capable systems.  With the appropriate systems engineering, advanced technologies-based satellite command and control capabilities can be incorporated into a new generation of transportable remote tracking station systems capable of deployment to any location with relative ease compared to current transportable systems.  These next generation ground stations could provide much needed support to operationally responsive space capabilities that support the warfighter.   Extensive networks for satellite control can be established for a fraction of the cost previously seen in networks like the AFSCN.  Potential commercial applications of the technologies demonstrated in this effort include the potential for small, low cost transportable satellite command and control ground stations.",J.

CFIRS is a standalone, portable, FACE-compliant, CMDS Operational Flight Program (OFP) that provides hardware abstraction, allowing it to be migrated from its original computing hardware to modern computing hardware (Intel i7, Xeon, ARM, or other processors) across various military platforms without significant redevelopment costs. The legacy OFP is tightly coupled to the current hardware and does not allow rehosting in new hardware without expensive modification to the original OFP. CFIRS addresses this problem through a FACE-based hardware-agnostic and Modular Open Systems Approach design by providing CMDS functionality as software that can be deployed on any hardware, thus saving the Navy sustainment costs.

of lymph node metastasis  Standard care includes chemotherapy  radiation  and or surgery  Cisplatin is a first line chemotherapy for lung cancer  but systemic intravenous  IV  delivery is confounded by various toxicities  renal toxicity is dose limiting   poor penetration into tumors and lymph nodes  organ damage  and resistance  Solution  Delivery of high dose  targeted cisplatin directly to lung cancers can increase the therapeutic window  increasing efficacy and renal safety  even in platinum resistant patients  Product  The product of this SBIR will be pulmonary delivery of an aerosolized chemotherapeutic  HylaPlat  that delivers high dose targeted cisplatin directly to the lungs targeting primary lung cancers and lymphatic metastases to replace IV cisplatin therapy for locally advanced CD    non small cell lung cancers  Innovation     Formulation  HylaPlatandapos s formulation is a hyaluronan  HA   cisplatin conjugate  Innovation     Aerosol Delivery Directly to Lungs  Direct administration to the lungs deposits HylaPlat at the site of action  The innovation of HylaPlat  which is the combination of its formulation and aerosolized delivery  has four major advantages      HA targets CD    tumor cells  CD   expression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis      High drug levels in lungs      High drug levels in lymph nodes targets metastases      Improved PK  Collectively  these advantages are expected to result in significantly increased efficacy and renal safety over standard of care IV cisplatin  Unlike many targeted cancer therapies in development that are limited to specific types of cancers  HylaPlat  has demonstrated efficacy in models of several cancer types  Most strikingly    or fewer doses of peri tumoral HylaPlat achieved a complete response in   of   dogs       presenting at a veterinary hospital with naturally occurring age related head and neck squamous cell carcinomas  significantly better than a    success rate with IV cisplatin  Therefore  the major unanswered question is whether pulmonary delivery of aerosolized HylaPlat is safe and effective for targeting lung cancers  Hypothesis  Pulmonary delivery of aerosolized HylaPlat will be more efficacious and more tolerable than IV cisplatin in rodent models of lung cancer  Preliminary results indicate that a single dose of aerosolized HylaPlat significantly attenuates the growth of lung cancer allografts in immunocompetent mice  In this project  we will establish feasibility of pulmonary delivery of aerosolized HylaPlat for lung cancer by demonstrating increased efficacy and preferential target tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics over standard of care IV cisplatin in rodent models  This Phase I SBIR will position aerosolized HylaPlat for IND  enabling studies  SBIR Phase II award   after which Hylapharm will seek partnerships for human phase I clinical trials PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I SBIR  HylaPharm  LLC plans to develop an aerosolized chemotherapeutic  HylaPlat  that is administered directly to the lungs targeting primary lung cancers and potential lymphatic metastases  This is relevant to public health because the local and targeted delivery of HylaPlat will prevent the spread of metastatic cancer  reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy  and lessen the need for extensive surgical resection and

Because the skull is fixed in volume, increases in the volume of its contents result in increases in intracranial pressure (ICP). Elevations of ICP can lead to worsening brain injury or death by compressing either blood vessels supplying the brain or vital brain structures themselves. Detecting and treating such increases in ICP is crucial to protecting the injured brain. Currently, the only methods to monitor ICP are invasive and require direct entry of a probe system through the skull. The major hypothesis of this proposal is that it is possible to monitor changes in intracranial pressure by non-invasive means using acoustic measurements. This method of measurement has significant advantages over current invasive measurements of monitoring ICP in that the measurements can be obtained conveniently and rapidly (in less than a minute) without invading the skull and with zero probability of infection. It is proposed to develop a practical instrument for monitoring changes in ICP using measurements of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and middle ear impedance. Initial evaluation and refinement of the instrument will involve healthy normal hearing subjects on a tilt table.

THE SYSTEM USESTWO REGENERABLE ABSORBENTS TO REMOVE SULFUR FROM THE HOT GASSTREAM AND PRODUCE ELEMENTAL SULFUR AS A PRODUCT FOR SALE. ZINC FERRITE REMOVES HALF OF THE SULFUR. THE SECOND, PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT REMOVES THE OTHER HALF OF THE SULFUR FROM THE HOT GAS STREAM. AFTER ABSORPTION OF H2S, THE PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT IS REGENERATED BY THE SO2 PRODUCED FROM ZINC FERRITE REGENERATION. THE PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT REACTS WITH THE SO2 LIBERATING ELEMENTAL SULFUR IN THE VAPORSTATE. CONDENSING THAT SULFUR PRODUCES A HIGH PURITY PRODUCT. TDA HAS EVALUATED THE THERMODYNAMICS OF THE REACTIONS IN THESYSTEM AT THE CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN A HOT GAS STREAM AND DURING REGENERATION. MORE THAN HALF OF THE H2S COULD BE REMOVED BY OUR PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT. THE REACTION OF THE PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT WITH SO2 WAS SHOWN TO OCCUR AT LOW SO2 CONCENTRATIONS. IN PHASE I THE REACTION OF THE ABSORBENT WITH LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF H2S IN THE PRESENCE OF HYDROGEN AND WATER WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. THE REGENERATION OF THE ABSORBENT WITH SIMULATED ZINC FERRITE REGENERATION GAS WILL ALSO BE DEMONSTRATED.

The sum of all health care costs in 2011 for cancer in the US was $88.7 billion. A low cost, less invasive, and more sensitive detector will allow earlier detection of cancer and thus lower the cost of treatment and increase survival rates. Higher sensitivity cancer detection will lead to early detection, enable targeted treatment, and save money and lives while improving quality of life. In addition, the knowledge learned from this grant can be applied to other sensors in which the nanowires are functionalized for detection of materials. These sensors could include sensors to support the Internet of Things, pollution monitoring, and ensuring high water quality. The proposed project will advance our knowledge of using nanowires as detectors. Nanowire sensors have a high surface area-to-volume ratio. Thus their detection limit is dramatically lowered and their sensitivity is increased relative to non-nanostructured sensors. This improvement is necessary for many biological assays. Others have made nanowire sensors and demonstrated high sensitivity. However, the fabrication techniques they use to make their sensors are expensive and slow. Thus, they are only able to get 1-10 nanowires per sensor and manufacturing throughput is low. This project will use a high-throughput and low-cost process, and that results in millions of nanowires per sensor. The nanowires will increase the surface area by over a thousand times thus allowing for more sensitive detection. Instead of using horizontal wires like the competition, the proposed sensor uses arrays of vertically aligned nanowires. The device design solves the typical challenges of contacting large arrays of nanowires and enables the measurement of both optical and electrical signals simultaneously. The proposed project will measure a commercially relevant biomarker for lung cancer. In addition, the investigators will detect two biomarkers on the same chip, thus demonstrating how the technology can be used to test multiple biomarkers on the same chip.",Marcie Black,,(954) 471-1357,marcie@advancedsilicongroup.com,Marcie Black,,(954) 471-1357,marcie@advancedsilicongroup.com,University of Iowa,Fatima Toor,,"['Small Business Technology Transfer', 'phase project', 'treatment cancer', 'sensitive', 'cancer', 'detection', 'die', 'health care', 'cost', 'cancer', 'cost', 'sensitive', 'detector', 'detection', 'cost treatment', 'survival rate', 'sensitivity', 'detection', 'target', 'treatment', 'quality', 'knowledge learn grant', 'sensor', 'nanowire', 'detection material', 'sensor', 'sensor', 'internet', 'pollution monitoring', 'water quality', 'knowledge', 'nanowire detector', 'nanowire', 'sensor', 'surface', 'area-to-volume ratio', 'detection limit', 'sensitivity', 'non-nanostructured', 'sensor', 'biological assay', 'nanowire', 'sensor', 'sensitivity', 'fabrication technique', 'sensor', 'nanowire', 'sensor', 'manufacturing', 'throughput low', 'high-throughput', 'low-cost process', 'nanowire', 'sensor', 'nanowire', 'surface area', 'sensitive', 'detection', 'sensor', 'use array', 'nanowire', 'device', 'contact', 'nanowire', 'measurement', 'optical electrical signal', 'lung cancer', 'detect', 'technology use test']"

Gag, Pol, and Nef are HIV proteins that have been reported to be useful for vaccine development. Evidence indicates that a broad cell-mediated immune (CMI) response is needed to treat or prevent HIV infection. Adenovirus (Ad) vector vaccines induce CMI responses and have emerged as a leading candidate to be used as a vaccine delivery platform. First Generation Ad vaccines have proven less effective than anticipated and adverse reactions are in question. Furthermore, pre-existing Ad immunity of most humans causes decreased effectiveness. To address these issues, we have developed an advanced Ad based vector that is devoid of early genes E1, E3, and E2B. ""E2B-deleted"" vectors, with deletions in the polymerase and preterminal protein genes, have an expanded cloning capacity and greatly reduced expression of viral late genes as compared to First Generation Ad vectors. Reduced expression of multiple Ad viral genes is advantageous for vaccine development for reasons such as reduced antigenic competition, greater longevity of expression that provides greater immunologic stimulus and reduced adverse effects. Such advantages are important in the presence of pre-existing Ad immunity since the Ad vector needs to be stealth-like. The Company has exclusive license from the U of M for the new Ad vector system and the E.C7 cell line, which supports vector production. The proposed vaccines based on the new E2B-deleted Ad vector system will carry fused Ad-gag-pol, fused Ad-gag-pol-nef and Clade C env genes. The HIV vaccines will be tested for their potential to induce CMI as a prime and for their re-immunization (boost) potential in Ad-naive and Ad-immune mice.  Upon completion of this project we will have developed a new platform for the delivery of HIV vaccines that is effective, safe, stable, cost effective, easy to distribute and use.  Our goal is to initiate non-human primate studies in the Phase II SBIR and a Phase I clinical trial using these or like vaccine product within two to three years of funding as pre-clinical data allows.",FRANK JONES,,(509) 962-4040,frj@etubics.com,RICHARD GAYLE,,(425) 591-4947,GAYLER@ETUBICS.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'adenoviral vector vaccine', 'cell-mediated immunity', 'animal', 'immune adenovirus hiv vaccine', 'nef hiv protein', 'vaccine development', 'cell-mediated immune ( cmi ) response', 'adenovirus', 'cmi response', 'vaccine delivery platform', 'question', 'ad immunity', 'effectiveness', 'issue', 'vector', 'e3', 'expression', 'Generation ad vector', 'expression', 'development', 'expression', 'adverse effect', 'ad immunity', 'ad vector', 'ad vector system', 'cell line', 'support vector production', 'ad vector system', 'fuse', 'fuse ad-gag-pol-nef clade c env gene', 'platform delivery', 'cost', 'goal', 'pre-clinical datum']"

The new decking solution would be integrated with the jet blast deflector (JBD) system to eliminate the need for active cooling systems and realize a significant reduction in maintenance requirements.

Goldman tonometry (GAT) IOP is recognized as the “gold standard”, but GAT IOP measurements errors have been identified. Phase I results indicated GAT IOP errors were over +/-2mmHg and up to +/-10mmHg in most patients. Those errors result in 50% of the population at risk for vision loss or over treatment. The GAT prism cannot accurately measure IOP due to corneal variabilities such as thicknesses, rigidity curvature, and tear film. Based on Phase I results, Intuor achieved FDA clearance on the CATS reusable prism. The Phase I results also showed CATS Prism improved IOP accuracy a 94% over GAT prism errors. The Phase II work will further the innovation and speed commercialization of CATS prism via ergonomic and manufacturing innovations. Addressing demonstrated market demand, Intuorandapos;s Phase II project will transfer and verify the CATS technology to an injection molded disposable prism with an enhanced ergonomic design. A disposable prism solves many current challenges presented by reusable prisms. The alcohol cleaning methodology for reusable GAT prisms currently used in practice resents a potential health hazard from cross-patient contamination and infection due to improper cleaning techniques. Additionally, reusable prisms are often replaced well past their serviceable life. Intuor plans to eliminate these health hazard by producing a competitively priced disposable prism via one step, injection molding. CATS disposable prism development will lead to a cost- effective prism greatly reducing potential cleaning agent corneal toxicity and infection potential. To achieve the tight tolerances and manufacturing capability requires innovative, iterative designs and multiple injection cycles. The second aspect of the Phase II is a clinically rigorous demonstration of CATS improved IOP accuracy via two distinct clinical studies for ineffectively served populations (pediatric and refractive surgery patients), so clinicians can confidently measure IOP to properly manage these populations. These two groups combined represent 30% of the general population. The clinical trial results will be leveraged into expanding the CATSandapos; currently FDA cleared indications for use with additional claims increasing marketability and utilization across all segments. If successful, these developments described above will eliminate the limitations of the IOP test while preserving its advantages of acceptance, simplicity, and cost.Intuor Technologies, LLC – Project Narrative Goldmann Contact Tonometry with Optimized Error Correction Intuor will build on the successful Phase I grant to engineer, test, and perform a clinical trial on a CATS disposable prism that addresses all known Goldmann Tonometer prism (GAT) intraocular eye pressure (IOP) errors. These GAT errors result in inaccurate IOP readings that are a critical barrier to providing earlier diagnosis and management of glaucoma, as well as treatment of currently ineffectively served populations, such as pediatric and LASIK patients. If successful, advancements from Phase II will enable the standard IOP measurement to realize its full potential as an accurate, cost-effective, safe, and non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and management of glaucoma.",SEAN MCCAFFERTY,,(520) 370-4113,sean@catsiop.com,SEAN MCCAFFERTY,,(520) 400-4255,nroosa@intuortec.com,,,,"['Goldmann Contact', 'Error correction intraocular pressure', 'measurement', 'visual acuity eye care', 'professional diagnose', 'gold standard', 'gat iop', 'measurement', 'phase result', 'gat iop', 'error', 'error', 'population risk vision loss', 'treatment', 'rigidity curvature', 'tear film', 'base phase', 'clearance cats', 'accuracy', 'gat prism error', 'phase', 'speed', 'commercialization cats', 'market', 'demand', 'phase', 'CATS technology injection mold', 'ergonomic design', 'disposable prism solve current', 'alcohol cleaning methodology', 'potential', 'health hazard', 'cleaning technique', 'plan', 'health hazard', 'injection molding', 'cleaning agent', 'potential', 'manufacturing', 'iterative design multiple', 'injection cycle', 'iop', 'accuracy', 'clinical study', 'refractive surgery', 'group', 'clinical trial', 'development', 'cost', 'Narrative Goldmann Contact', 'Error correction', 'phase grant engineer', 'test', 'clinical trial', 'intraocular eye pressure', 'gat error', 'critical barrier', 'diagnosis', 'management glaucoma', 'treatment', 'advancement phase', 'standard iop', 'measurement', 'potential', 'cost-effective', 'non-invasive', 'diagnosis', 'management glaucoma']"

Currently, asthma afflicts 22.9 million people in the U.S., and tracheomalacia is believed to afflict 3 million people in the U.S. In addition to these chronic or deadly conditions, intervention into the bronchial passageways with bronchoscopic procedures can cause bronchial granulation tissue that obstructs airflow. These diseases of the bronchi each may potentially be treated with local, direct infusion of medications into the bronchial wall and adventitia (the tissue between smooth muscle layers and cartilage). In fact, data suggests that diseases of the bronchi arise in the sub-epithelial bronchial wall, and thus local treatment beyond the epithelium is warranted. Despite the magnitude of these problems, and the potential for a simple solution, there exists no device useful to deliver safely and reliably into the bronchial wall. Mercator MedSystems has developed a vascular adventitial infusion catheter that has FDA 510(k) clearance to market for use in humans. This is an endovascular balloon catheter which extrudes a single needle through the vessel wall when the balloon is inflated, thus allowing direct therapeutic access to the adventitia. It has been discovered that vascular adventitial delivery leads to cylindrical deposition of drugs around the vessel, creating a natural drug-eluting reservoir. In this proposal, we hypothesize that by tailoring the Mercator Micro-Infusion Catheter for bronchial use, we can show that local infusion into the bronchial wall is safe and can result in an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile. We intend to verify that the device can be sized up from its current 8 mm diameter to 16 mm diameter for bronchial use while remaining compatible with the 2.8 mm working channel of bronchoscopes (Specific Aim 1). After this, we will test simple saline infusion into pig bronchial adventitia and analyze the tissue for damage at different volume infusions from 0.05 ml to 1.0 ml (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will establish the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of paclitaxel, a drug that may be used for local chemotherapy or to reduce the buildup of granulation tissue, at doses ranging from 1 to 100 ltM (Specific Aim 3). We believe that the significance of this proposal lies in the fact that (a) we plan to test out a novel and innovative local drug delivery device for a recalcitrant clinical problem, (b) learning the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of a common chemotherapeutic and antirestenotic drug like paclitaxel can have broad-ranging clinical impact, (c) bronchial adventitial therapy may be more effective in the prevention and treatment of bronchial maladies than inhalation or systemic therapies, and (d) therapeutic success in the delivery of paclitaxel for the treatment of bronchial carcinoma could be rapidly translated to other clinical settings characterized by bronchial narrowing. Indeed, all of the above suggest a huge commercial potential for the Mercator MedSystems device, if these initial pilot studies are successful.

Unlike conventional optical manufacturing processes that require extensive hand work, Opticam technology produces optical surfaces having shapes that are accurately determined by the geometry of the grinding machine. Surface errors produced during tubular grinding are closely related to the relative alignment of the tool and workpiece. This makes it possible to predict the errors produced by various types of misalignment, and thereby make it possible to correct the alignment of the machine by inspecting a manufactured part.

The improved wear (relative to commercial diamond tools) is achieved by orienting diamond crystals on the tips of specially designed cutter inserts, so as to exploit the anisotropy in diamond hardness. The reduction in tip wear enhances the precision of machining in uninterrupted cuts. The advantage is most clearly seen when hard ceramics, such as SiC, are machined, but the new cutter technology also provides benefits in machining certain metallic systems. Another innovation is the fabrication of a set of spherically-shaped Diamonite? smoothers, which improve the quality of the finishing operation; thus, for the first time, giving an ultra-smooth surface finish. The combined innovations should enable the optics industry to enhance the performance of large telescopes and interferometers. In Phase I, we designed a special diamond cutting tool for SiC, manufactured samples of cutters and smoothers, conducted research on machining and smoothing of mirror materials, and proved the validity of the concept. In Phase II, we propose to develop ultra-smooth diamond tooling and diamond tool fabrication techniques. The deliverables are diamond-TiC-Ti cutters to achieve higher precision of turning and Diamonite? smoothers to realize better surface finish.   In addition, procedures for the reproducible fabrication of mirror optics will be defined.

CAD remains the most common form of heart disease, afflicting more than 18 million adults and costing the U.S. healthcare system over $90 billion annually. Advances in diagnostics to improve treatment decisions have lagged behind advances in therapies. The proposed research will explore novel computational modeling methods within an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform to improve diagnosis and optimize patient-specific treatment decisions. Value propositions are to improve clinical outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and save lives. The software will provide competitive advantages as a more user-friendly and non-invasive diagnostic method capable of faster and more accurate clinical assessment of CAD than existing alternatives.This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will advance the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) to optimize patient-specific treatment decisions. CAD patients typically undergo an angiography procedure whereby coronary arteries are visualized to estimate stenosis severity and make subjective treatment decisions on whether to perform revascularization procedures (e.g., stenting or bypass graft surgeries). More recently Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), a measure of the pressure gradient across the vessel stenosis, has demonstrated improved outcomes when guiding treatment decisions. However, adoption of FFR remains modest given shortcomings of available interventional devices and cost. Recently, commercial efforts have developed computer-based methods to estimate FFR non-invasively, although with limited accuracy in borderline values of FFR. The proposed research will develop and calibrate a Reduced Order Model (ROM) using novel machine learning and computational methods to provide FFR measures in a faster, more accurate, and more integrated manner with clinical workflows than existing solutions. The ROM will rely on recent advances in Graph Theory to enhance a 1D nonlinear formulation of blood flow. The method will be calibrated using synthetic data generated with ground truth 3D Navier-Stokes solutions and validated against clinical measurements of FFR from a cohort of 20 patients.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",Serafin Samson,,(612) 986-5976,ssamson@angioinsight.com,Serafin Samson,,(612) 986-5976,ssamson@angioinsight.com,Regents of the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor,,,"['Small Business Technology Transfer', 'phase project', 'clinical care', 'coronary artery disease', 'cost', 'heart disease', 'cost', 'healthcare system', 'treatment', 'decision lag', 'therapy', 'computational modeling method', 'artificial intelligence', 'diagnosis', 'patient-specific treatment decision', 'clinical outcome', 'healthcare cost', 'non-invasive', 'diagnostic method', 'clinical assessment', 'Small Business Technology Transfer', 'phase project', 'diagnosis', 'coronary artery disease', 'patient-specific treatment decision', 'angiography procedure coronary artery visualize', 'subjective treatment', 'revascularization procedure', 'stenting bypass graft surgery', 'Fractional Flow Reserve (', 'measure pressure gradient vessel stenosis', 'outcome', 'treatment decision', 'interventional device', 'cost', 'computer-based method', 'non-invasively', 'accuracy', 'machine learning', 'computational method', 'solution', 'Graph theory', 'nonlinear formulation blood flow', 'method', 'synthetic datum', 'ground truth 3D Navier-Stokes solution', 'clinical measurement', 'mission', 'evaluation', 'impact', 'review']"

Multiple doses are often used, at high cost (app.$250), to insure detection of small lesions. Metasyn is planning to compete with these products withan agent with much higher relativity and the same cost as a single dose of the conventional agents (app.$85).

Light units used for treating SAD in the past have generally emitted polychromatic white light of highly variable spectral properties.  Although several studies have attempted to test the effectiveness of specific wavelengths of red, blue and green light for treatment of SAD, the devices used in those studies employed relatively broad bandwidths of light.  With the technological advancements in light emitting diodes (LEDs), the production of new light treatment equipment with much narrower bandwidths of light is possible.  A recently completed action spectrum demonstrated that 446-477 nm is the most potent wavelength range for regulating melatonin secretion.  These results suggest that a novel opsin photopigment, separate from the four classical visual opsins, mediates the effects of light on melatonin and raises the possibility that light treatment for SAD may share a common photoreceptor system and therefore, a similar spectral sensitivity.  The specific aims of this proposed study are to: 1) produce an LED panel light box which emits narrow band light stimuli with a 470 nm peak (30 nm half-peak bandwidth) for light treatment of SAD; 2) confirm safety of this device through a hazard analysis based on accepted federal and industrial guidelines, and 3) use this device to test the hypothesis that light stimuli concentrated in the 470 nm range is therapeutically effective in treating SAD.  Therapeutic efficacy will be tested in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study design comparing a narrow band LED light source with a spectral peak at 470 nm (30 nm half-peak bandwidth) to a narrow band dim red light placebo control with peak emission at 700 nm.  Demonstration of efficacy of relatively narrow bandwidth blue light will pave the way for future studies in which this spectral range may be further tested for SAD treatment and circadian rhythm dysfunctions in order to maximize therapeutic benefits with lower light intensities and therefore, fewer side effects.",HENRY SAVAGE JR,,(801) 226-2370,KENT@APOLLOLINGHT.COM,HENRY SAVAGE,,(801) 226-2370,KENT@APOLLOLIGHT.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'bright light therapy', 'seasonal affective disorder', 'sad', 'SAD', 'polychromatic white light', 'variable', 'effectiveness', 'wavelength red', 'blue green light', 'SAD', 'device use study', 'bandwidth light', 'technological advancement light emitting', 'diode', 'production', 'light treatment', 'action spectrum', 'visual opsin', 'effect light', 'possibility light', 'treatment', 'SAD', 'photoreceptor system', 'spectral sensitivity', 'study', 'panel light box', 'treatment', 'SAD', 'safety', 'device', 'hazard analysis', 'industrial', 'device test', 'hypothesis light', 'SAD', 'therapeutic efficacy test', 'randomized cross-over study design', 'narrow band', 'narrow band dim red light', 'peak emission', 'bandwidth blue light', 'study', 'sad', 'effect']"

The standard navigation approach when GPS is available is to use a combination of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and GPS measurements for continuous positioning. IMU data is used for prediction and GPS is used to update the position estimates. In the absence of GPS, alternative sensing methods are used with IMU data to estimate the position.

Genetic dissection of complex disease and variations of drug response has become one of the most important genetic research topics in recent years. Although genome-wide association studies are thought to hold the promise to identify susceptibility genes responsible to complex diseases, methodologies to take full advantage of the genotyping data are still lacking. Standard approaches typically only consider a limited number of hypotheses, most of which are on the effect of a single locus or a relative few loci, therefore do not accommodate the full range of genetic mechanisms that may contribute to the disease phenotype and variations of drug response. First Genetic Trust Inc. (FGT) has developed an innovative pattern discovery-based method to identify multi-locus genetic associations (enGENIOUS). Upon successful demonstration of the utilities and power of enGENIOUS in a SBIR phase I grant awarded by NCI in 2003, FGT intends to use this SBIR phase II proposal to further develop its proprietary genetic analysis methodology as well as to develop a software platform to commercialize the novel methodology along with others as a general tool box. In phase II of the project, FGT will extend enGENIOUS on a genome-wide scale, and will demonstrate the utility of combining enGENIOUS and selected conventional methodologies in whole genome association analysis by using whole-genome datasets from a FGT collaborator. Additionally, FGT will develop a comprehensive software package including an object data model for the representation of concepts (like data, analyses, results, etc.) in genetic analysis, an extensible Java software development toolkit for genetics (enGENUITYsdk) that implement the object model, an object-relational database for storing phenotypic and genotypic data, and a genetic analysis workbench (enGENUITY Workbench) that is either tightly integrated with FGT's enTRUST Genetic Banking System or as a stand-alone application.

Visual images projecting around the fovea, are masked in real-time, by feeding eye position signals into a computer controlled visual display, safely creating the appearance of a scotoma. A image shift system consists of copying the visual image covered by the scotoma, and re-displaying that image at an eccentric viewing position on peripheral retina. Feasibility tests use two criteria: 1) the effectiveness of image shifting in compensating for performance losses due to foveal scotoma, and 2) the occurrence and effect of abnormal eye movements created by image shifting.

One such ldquo;defectrdquo; is related to metal vapor condensate contamination. One of the benefits of the EBAM process is its efficient use of power as well as the high purity vacuum environment. These process characteristics allow EBAM to provide fast deposition speeds that in many cases lead the industry. One side effect of this high deposition rate with the vacuum is that the raw material is often vaporized at a high rate as well and this metal vapor condenses back into solid form on surfaces local to the process. Over time the condensate build up can become substantial and occurrences have been observed where the condensate gets dislodged and can fall into the melt pool. Sciaky has learned that in the case of EBAM deposition targeting Ti-6Al-4V, the condensate is made up of predominantly aluminum.nbsp; This issue is a well-documented concern when processing alloys with elements having various vapor pressures in a high vacuum environment.nbsp; If the condensate becomes entrapped within the molten pool, the local area no longer achieves the target chemistry or metallurgical properties.nbsp; There has been at least one instance where the condensate provided a crack initiation site that resulted catastrophic failure of a preform in response to residual stress buildup.Our phase 1 approach will target the real-time identification of metal condensate events, document the location of detected events and provide the basis for corrective action avoiding the scrapping of a part.

We propose to develop the first true nonlinearity compensator in a robust, miniature-sized platform, fully compatible with the existing FOG technology. In this program, we will perform in-depth computational modeling, based on proven theoretical frameworks, that will be quantitatively validated and benchmarked by experiments in a state-of-the-art research facility.  Successful completion of this program will result in calculation of the ultimate performance limitations of the proposed design, derivation of the engineering rules governing practical operation of the nonlinearity compensator, and a baseline design for a Phase II program.",John Marciante,Managing Member,(585) 748-2900,john.marciante@ramphotonics.com,John Marciante,Managing Member,(585) 748-2900,john.marciante@ramphotonics.com,Stub,,,"['fiber-optic gyroscope', 'building block', 'high-precision inertial angular displacement', 'sensor', 'missile', 'war-plane satellite navigation', 'non-reciprocity', 'critical impairment', 'sensing accuracy', 'precision', 'effect', 'development', 'kerr-effect', 'non-reciprocity', 'mitigation', 'precision', 'navigation instrumentation', 'generation angular', 'displacement', 'sensor', 'technology', 'program', 'computational modeling', 'theoretical framework', 'benchmarke', 'state-of-the-art research facility', 'completion program', 'performance', 'design', 'derivation engineering', 'baseline design phase']"

In the pharmaceutical industry, modern drug discovery has brought a large number of drug candidates; however, 80-90% of them are poorly water-soluble. In addition, roughly 40% of newly commercialized drug molecules are poorly water-soluble. Low solubility greatly hinders drug dissolution and is detrimental to drug safety and efficacy. To address this grand challenge, a number of excipients have been developed; however, they can only solve part of the solubility problems. New multi-functional, potent excipients are highly desirable for the pharmaceutical industry. The goal of this project is evaluate the commercial potential of NBBE as pharmaceutical excipients to stabilize and solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs. Early work has shown extraordinary capability of NBBE in solubilizing poorly water-soluble drugs, which can hardly be achieved by other drug excipients. To evaluate the commercial potential of NBBE, the objectives of this project are to: (1) prepare NBBE and NBBE-drug formulations, and evaluate their stability and solubility, and (2) assess the safety and efficacy of NBBE-drug formulations. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be realized through significantly enhanced drug efficacy and safety, reduced drug formulation hurdles, and simplified drug-manufacturing process. In this project, university professors and a business leader bring together expertise in materials science, drug formulation, and business development. They have created a solid foundation for this project. Leading researchers for this STTR project have close relationships with the pharmaceutical industry, and they constantly receive important guidance from major pharmaceutical companies. The industrial support is critical to directing this project through defining the matrices and deliverables for successful commercialization. NBBE are biobased and sustainable since they can be manufactured from natural, abundant plant sources, which secure the sustainability and economic advantages of NBBE over numerous petroleum-based competing materials. Associated with this project, the team has been highly successful in developing the platform technology, communicating to potential investors, and collaborating with potential customers.

These mobile devices are managed by employees, contain personal data, and use diverse hardware and software systems. The company developed a new web browser, which they built from the ground up specifically for mobile devices. The company&#039;s mission is to use their browser as a platform for enterprise developers to build and deploy cross-­platform enterprise-­class mobile web apps. The fundamental question this research will answer is whether a browser can be a suitable platform for hosting enterprise mobile apps. As such, this research has three primary objectives. (1) Advance the state-­of-­the-­art in mobile web app design methodology by developing new abstractions, such as web push and background execution, that enable mobile web apps to access native features in a platform independent way. (2) Develop a system that encapsulates enterprise mobile web apps and data securely, with management functions to enable information technology (IT) staff to manage enterprise apps, data, and users. (3) Implement advanced debugging tools for web app developers. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in enabling enterprises to use mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, in the workplace to accesscompany apps and data securely. Although mobile devices provide workers with ubiquitous access to enterprise apps and data, employees often use these mobile devices for work and in their personal lives.

Neurotoxic ?-amyloid peptides (A??) are thought to cause the disease with their accumulation in brain plaques being a hallmar k. A? are cleaved from a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteases, called ?? and ?-secretases. Compounds that inhibit ?-secretase may stop the progression of the disease by reducing the production of A?.  CA074Me and loxistatin (also known as E6 4d or EST) are cysteine protease inhibitors and the cysteine protease, cathepsin B, is a candidate 2-secretase in the regulated secretory pathway. The inhibiton of brain 2-secretase by these compounds is likely due to inhibition of cathepsin B ? -secretase  activity. Although loxistatin has been shown safe to use in humans, non-specific binding by this compound, and the structurally similar CA074Me, may limit their therapeutic use.  Reversible protease inhibitors offer potential pharmacological advantages as  AD therapeutics. This grant, therefore, will develop reversible, small molecule, cathepsin B inhibitors and determine their efficacy in various AD models.

The requirement-optimized hardware, reduced deployment costs, improved data accuracy, and increased installation flexibility are provided by removing wiring constraints, creating a system with a higher total value per channel.

The principal challenge associated with the use of Si-based substrates is the presence of dislocations, created by the large lattice mismatch, that thread into the HgCdTe epilayers and thereby degrade device performance. Our Phase I effort showed that it is possible to passivate dislocations with the introduction of hydrogen atoms using a high density plasma source.

EM is a self-assembled lipid-peptidic hybrid nanoparticle with a high per particle payload of hemoglobin (Hb) that is specifically designed to rectify failures of previous hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, which do not preserve key features of RBC physiology. The bio-inspired EM design surmounts previous obstacles by emulating RBC features: long term stability, precise dynamically-responsive allosteric effector control of Hb oxygen affinity, control of Hb interaction with nitric oxide (NO), preventing vasospasm, and mitigation of hemoglobin oxidation via payload antioxidants. EM is designed for sterile lyophilization enabling extended shelf life at ambient conditions and offers cost-effective production at scale. KaloCyte has developed a pragmatic yet robust stepwise goal-oriented development plan for GMP commercialization including the scale- up and cGMP manufacturing of ErythroMer and its key ingredients, customized lipid precursor, and hemoglobin. Previously completed studies on the synthesis and scale-up of the lipid precursor, and the purification of hemoglobin from red blood cells (RBCs) have been extremely promising. These studies provide strong evidence of the premise for and feasibility of this proposal and our commitment for the manufacturing scale-up, purification and analytical method development, validation, and qualification of the lipid precursor. The pre-IND stage preclinical studies require EM volumes larger than and at a quality that necessitates CDMO services. Successful completion of the scale-up and analytical work proposed in the current submission will provide KaloCyte the confidence in the manufacturing processes for KC1003, and that the components being used for the fabrication of EM are of the highest quality and fall within the acceptable specifications required by the regulatory agencies. The manufacturing scale-up of KC1003 will include scale specific optimization of key parameters for it manufacturing such as temperature, time, pressure, and reactant concentrations at each step of its manufacturing process. Analytical methods development, validation, and optimization for KC1003, shall be performed as per ICH guidelines recommended by the FDA. Statistical analysis of methods validation data shall be performed to demonstrate the validity of each method. Completion of these steps in the path to product commercialization, will help complete IND-enabling preclinical studies for EM under strict GLP guidelines. EM has the capability to dramatically transform care in life-threatening blood loss situations where stored red blood cells (RBCs) are unavailable (ambulances, military and austere environments, undeveloped countries), undesirable (situations in which risk of transfusion exceeds benefit), or in short supply (mass casualty events).PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a need for an artificial oxygen carrier to care for patients in settings where banked human blood is unavailable or undesirable. To address this need, we have developed ‘ErythroMer’ (EM), a first-in-class bio- synthetic, nano-cyte, blood substitute.

This team will develop and test the  Microvascular1Functional Imaging System (MFIS),  a device that can be easily adopted for both a clinical environment and a tele-screening setting. Diabetes afflicts an estimated 171 million people worldwide, including more than 24 million Americans. Diabetic patients are at risk for a wide array of complications including heart disease, kidney disease (nephropathy), ocular diseases (diabetic retinopathy), and peripheral neuropathy (diabetic foot). Two million diabetics will develop a foot ulcer during their lifetime. Foot ulcers are the main cause, 85 percent, of lower extremity amputation in patients with diabetes. Our MFIS device is aimed to show that differencesin the functional signals will reveal pre- clinical indications of peripheral neuropathy. There are three specific aims to be accomplished in Phase I. The first aim is to integrate, calibrate and test the MFIS device. The second aim is to use the MFIS toconduct a clinical study using subjects to be recruited at the University of New Mexico Endocrinology Clinic. In the third aim we will use advanced signal and image processing techniques, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), to extract low-level signals resulting from the functional response captured in thermal and spectral videos.

The cost of harvesting algae from 0.1–0.5 wt.% in cultures to 20-30 wt. % concentrates is a critical driver for initial capital, energy and resource costs of algal fuel and products. Energy-efficient and scalable harvesting technologies must be developed for the algal industry to thrive. Cross-flow filtration and vacuum filtering using unique ThinSieveTM membranes recently developed at Molecule Works Inc. are proposed to harvest algae in two process steps. The cross-flow filtration concentrates an algal culture into thick slurry of 2- 5 wt.% solid. Then, the concentrate is dewatered on a vacuum filter into wet cakes of 20-30 wt. % solids. The membranes are the critical component that determines cost and efficiency of the membrane processes. Molecule Works’s ThinSieveTM membranes comprise a 50 micro-meter -thin porous metal sheet with ceramic coatings. The uniform and small-size pores on the membrane surface exclude algal cells and allow 100% algal harvesting. Since no strange chemicals or materials are used in the membrane process, almost all (>99%) the water and soluble in original cultures can be recycled. Thinness of the ThinSieveTM membrane provides exceptionally high flux compared to the other membrane materials of similar pore sizes and enables fabrication of membrane modules with high packing density (>1000 m2/m3). The ceramic/metallic material is biocidal and resistant to bio-fouling and bonding by biological cells, which are rich in algal cultures. The ThinSieveTM membrane can be cleaned and reused for long-term operation. The high flux, high membrane packing density, and reusability of the ThinSieveTM membrane makes it possible to reduce energy consumption and capital cost by 30% relative to DOE’s base case. In Phase I, the ThinSieveTM membrane structures will be optimized to achieve the proposed performance targets for the concentration and de-watering of a few different algal species. Effective membrane cleaning methods will be developed to obtain stable filtering performances through periodic cleaning/regeneration. A cross-flow module prototype of 1-m2 membrane area will be assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of building high throughput membrane modules.

Separations for these and other applications are growing rapidly as a result of increasing environmental, safety and energy regulation as well as the increased risk of chemical warfare by terrorist organizations.  For the separation of species from dilute streams, the most preferred method is adsorption.  Activated carbons are the preferred adsorbent because of their very high surface area and low costs.

By partitioning the assay away from the bulk solution, the signal-to-noise ratio increases greatly. Assays have been lyophilized and rehydrated with little or no loss of performance against key surface peptides, an albumin-peptide conjugate and irradiated CCHF virus. Therefore, OpTech proposes to continue development by testing the assay in serum with viable CCHF virus of several types and other related and unrelated viruses in BSL-4 laboratory facilities of the Southwest Research Foundation for Biomedical Research (SwFBR) co-located with OpTech in San Antonio. OpTech will conduct several rounds of live virus testing with the SwFBR and, if necessary, re-select aptamer sequences to detect the broadest possible array of CCHF viruses with ultrasensitivity. OpTechs commercial off-the-shelf handheld and battery-operated fluorometer will also be refitted with a new LED excitation source, red band pass emission filter, power adaptor for military vehicles, coupler to a PDA or small laptop, and more user friendly firmware.

If the energy cost is low, the supplies are likely good, but for areas lacking fresh water, the energy usage is high. Energy use has a direct monetary correlation, and typically, greenhouse gas related environmental consequences. The water-energy requirement is highest for locations where potable water must be obtained by desalination (purification) or delivery by land, sea, or air. The design and implementation of desalination systems utilizing sustainable renewable energy sources would be beneficial in many communities that currently pay a high energy cost for potable water. Aquaneers Inc. proposes this Phase I DOE SBIR/STTR project for the development of a Solar Desalination System (SDS) that operates by virtue of an innovative Photo-Thermal (PT) Solar Cell. The PT cell generates steam when illuminated in an aqueous environment and is used to facilitate a highly efficient solar distillation process in the SDS. Plasmonic nanostructures that convert light into heat are incorporated into a three dimensional plasmonic crystal type structure that comprises the PT solar cell. The PT cell uses solar energy to generate steam within the SDS, which is condensed and collected as pure water end product. In future work, the solar steam can also be energy harvested as electricity in the condensation process. In the Phase I program, Aquaneers will advance its SDS prototype efforts through continued design iterations using 3D printing. The initial product is a small scale (1-10 person, 10-100 liters) water desalination system designed for customers in the military or humanitarian relief spaces. Research will be performed in optimizing the PT cell performance and manufacturing process, the SDS solar optical and water collection subsystems, and the overall device design and performance metrics. The demonstration of a self-contained solar-powered water-desalination system that has efficient operation in an economical design that can be scaled into a commercial product during Phase II is the primary goal of the Phase I project. The commercialization of Aquaneers SDS would be of societal benefit in a world where nearly 1 billion people lack access to safe water and global warming brought on by fossil fuel based energy overuse is a looming disaster. Energy requirements typically make desalination a choice only when other water options are exhausted. Nonetheless, increased global demand for water concurrent with resource depletion leads many to look to the bountiful reserves of the oceans. Desalination is highly compatible with solar energy use, as purified water can be generated during sunny hours and readily stored for later use Climate change is a substantial cause of current water shortages, and thus, renewable energy-based desalination technologies are essential to fulfill water needs while not furthering the problem. Aquaneers current target market lies in the $1Billion/year portable (point of use) water desalination (purification) industry, a subset of the $27B/year global desalination market.

MicroRNAs bind to specific mRNAs to promote their degradation. A major goal is to discover microRNAs that contribute to cellular and disease processes. The ability to discover microRNAs involved in cellular pathways using unbiased genomic screening is highly limited. In contrast to mRNAs, microRNAs cannot be easily screened in a genome-wide manner for their role in diverse processes using bar-coded lentiviral CRISPR and shRNA libraries. Here we propose a fundamentally new approach that will lead to a highly efficient library for screening all microRNAs encoded by the genome. Our approach is to express a library of circular RNAs that act as “microRNA sponges,” each tailored to sequester a specific microRNA in the genome. Although circular RNAs are known to be effective microRNA sponges, the inability to express circular RNAs at high levels in cells has limited their ability to sponge microRNAs, which are highly abundant. Chimerna scientists, while working at Cornell University, developed a fundamentally new strategy to express circular RNA at 100X higher levels than any other previous expression system. Because of this powerful and recently developed circular RNA expression system, we can now generate libraries of circular RNA sponges that can systematically sponge each microRNA in the cell. Chimerna scientists have generated key poof-of-concept data demonstrating the efficacy of this approach with a circular RNA that sponges microRNA miR-19. In order to develop and optimize microRNA sponges to make them suitable for creating a genome-wide lentiviral library, the specific aims of this proposal are (1) To optimize circular RNA sponges to achieve maximal depletion of microRNA activity in cells. In this subaim, we will optimize the sponging activity of circular RNA sponges by testing the optimal spacing and the number of microRNA-binding sites. Additionally, microRNA sponges will be developed that can sponge multiple co-regulated microRNAs. Overall, these experiments will lead to optimized RNA circles that are highly effective in sponging one or more microRNA seed families. (2) To systematically test and reduce off-target effects of circular microRNA sponges. In this aim we will optimize circular RNA sponges by reducing any off-target effects. We will use a gene expression analysis approach to quantify the degree of on-target and off-target effects induced by the circular RNA sponges. To remove any off-target effects, we will systematically mutate sequences that may contribute to these effects. Together, these experiments will result in circular RNAs that have reduced off target effects and will therefore be more suitable for developing a microRNA-sponging library. Overall, this project will result in optimized circular RNA sponges with maximal sponging activity and reduced off-target effects on gene expression. The resulting circles, which will be expressed in a lentiviral system, will be suitable for the next phase of this project, which will involve construction of a genome-wide library, targeting over 2000 microRNAs.PROJECT NARRATIVE MicroRNAs are important genomic elements that regulate diverse cellular and disease-related processes. Currently, it is difficult to perform genome-wide screens to discover microRNAs that are critical cellular regulators of these pathways and processes. In this application, we propose a novel approach for genome- wide screening of individual microRNA function using libraries of circular RNA sponges that become highly effective due to the use of a novel technology for highly efficient cellular expression circular RNA.",BRIAN PICKERING,,(281) 687-7549,brian.pickering@chimerna.com,BRIAN PICKERING,,(281) 687-7549,brian.pickering@chimerna.com,,,,"['gene expression', 'bind', 'degradation', 'cellular disease process', 'cellular pathway', 'genomic screening', 'genome-wide manner', 'bar-coded', 'library screen', 'genome', 'circular rna high level', 'cell limit', 'circular rna 100x high', 'level', 'expression system', 'circular rna expression system', 'genome-wide', 'proposal', 'microrna activity', 'sponging activity', 'circular rna sponge test', 'spacing number', 'microrna-binding site', 'rna circle', 'seed family', 'systematically test', 'off-target', 'effect', 'off-target', 'effect', 'gene expression analysis', 'on-target', 'off-target', 'off-target', 'effect', 'target', 'effect', 'off-target', 'effect', 'gene expression', 'lentiviral system', 'phase project', 'construction genome-wide library', 'target', 'genomic element', 'cellular', 'genome-wide screen', 'wide screening', 'microrna function', 'technology', 'cellular expression circular rna']"

Osteoarthritis (OA), the clinical syndrome of joint pain and dysfunction caused by joint degeneration, affects more people than any other joint disease. There are no consistently effective methods for preventing OA or slowing its progression, and so symptomatic treatments represent the standard of care, the foundation of which are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Such treatments for OA require consideration of not only gastrointestinal (GI) risk, but also cardiovascular (CV) risk; non-selective NSAIDs acting on both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 universally increase the risk of GI injury, whereas nearly all NSAIDs, especially the selective COX-2 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the risk of serious CV events. The withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib from the market amplify the continuing need for an NSAID with minimal CV and GI risks. Naproxen has become the NSAID of choice for most mild/moderate chronic inflammatory indications, including OA, as it appears to have little or no increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events. However, in spite of its favorable CV safety profile, naproxen is well known to induce GI toxicity that is sometimes life-threatening. The activities proposed in this grant application are intended to advance a new naproxen formulation (Naproxen-PC) that not only improves the GI safety of naproxen using a non-COX mechanism, but also may enhance anti-inflammatory activity compared with naproxen. Naproxen-PC improves GI safety by increasing the lipophilicity of the NSAID via non- covalent pre-association with a surface-active phospholipid, namely phosphatidylcholine (PC). This oil-based formulation of PC-associated naproxen (Naproxen-PC) has been shown in rodent models to have remarkably lower (~85%) GI toxicity, while retaining the efficacy and general safety profile of unmodified naproxen. Recently, novel methods have been developed to profile bioactive lipids in a model of joint inflammation, including products of both cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX). Preliminary data assaying a range of bioactive lipids suggests that Naproxen-PC may have enhanced anti-inflammatory efficacy, as reflected in the attenuation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 12- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), and 5-HETE), while sparing anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (13- hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE)), compared with unmodified naproxen, in a rodent model of joint inflammation. The major objective of this Fast-Track SBIR application is to confirm the preliminary data described above and continue and expand the development of Naproxen-PC and initiate clinical studies. In Phase I, initial activities will focus on expanding and confirming the enhanced anti-inflammatory activity of Naproxen-PC seen in animal models. Also, in partnership with a commercial manufacturer, we propose to optimize the laboratory formulation of Naproxen-PC so that it may be softgel encapsulated and manufactured for clinical trials. Several lead prototypes resulting from this optimization will be identified that appear commercially viable, which will be tested in established animal models with both GI safety and analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy endpoints. The results of these experiments will allow selection of a single, validated lead Naproxen-PC formulation. In Phase II, the lead formulation will be manufactured as 250 mg Naproxen-PC gelcaps according to regulatory standards, further tested for stability, then advanced into clinical trials. Initially, a single-dose bioequivalence (BE) study, comparing Naproxen-PC with unmodified naproxen, will be completed in healthy volunteers; this pharmacokinetics study will provide BE data for Naproxen-PC FDA approval via the accelerated 505(b)(2) regulatory route, and provide data on the systemic safety of Naproxen- PC. Then, a comparative proof-of-concept clinical trial will be conducted examining analgesic efficacy, general safety and the incidence of gastrointestinal ulcers, assessed endoscopically, in patients with osteoarthritis aged 55 years or older, following administration of 500 mg Naproxen-PC or naproxen BID for 12 weeks. The development activities encompassed in this grant proposal will significantly advance the Naproxen-PC development toward commercialization. If the Naproxen-PC formulation is shown in subsequent confirmatory clinical trials to possess an improved GI safety profile, together with equivalent analgesic and perhaps superior anti-inflammatory efficacy compared with naproxen, it will represent an important new treatment for patients with osteoarthritis and related chronic inflammatory diseases.",JASON MOORE,,(713) 842-1249,ron.zimmerman@plxpharma.com,UPENDRA MARATHI,,(713) 842-1249,MARATHI@PLXPHARMA.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'abstract', 'application phase', 'application', 'clinical syndrome joint pain dysfunction', 'joint degeneration', 'people joint disease', 'method', 'treatment', 'standard care', 'non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug', 'treatment', 'consideration gastrointestinal ( gi ) risk', 'cardiovascular ( cv ) risk', 'non-selective nsaid act cyclooxygenase-1 ( cox-1 )', 'gi injury', 'market', 'cv gi risk', 'cv safety profile', 'activity', 'grant application', 'naproxen-pc', 'gi safety', 'mechanism', 'anti-inflammatory activity', 'gi safety', 'surface-active phospholipid', 'oil-based formulation', 'rodent model', 'low', 'general safety profile', 'method', 'bioactive lipid model joint inflammation', 'product cyclooxygenase ( cox ) lipoxygenase', 'preliminary datum', 'bioactive lipid', 'anti-inflammatory', 'attenuation', 'hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid', 'anti-inflammatory', 'hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid', 'rodent model joint inflammation', 'Fast-Track', 'application', 'development', 'naproxen-pc', 'clinical study', 'phase', 'activity focus', 'anti-inflammatory activity', 'animal model', 'laboratory formulation', 'manufacture', 'clinical trial', 'optimization', 'animal model', 'anti-inflammatory', 'phase', 'lead formulation manufacture', 'regulatory standard', 'test stability', 'clinical trial', 'single-dose', 'pharmacokinetic study', 'systemic safety', 'general safety', 'gastrointestinal ulcer', 'aged', 'development', 'activity', 'proposal', 'development', 'commercialization', 'confirmatory clinical trial', 'gi safety profile', 'anti-inflammatory', 'treatment', 'chronic inflammatory disease']"

We propose the following novel framework for audio clustering. First, we propose to apply computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) as a front-end to separate speech signals from non-speech background noise. Inspired by auditory perception, CASA typically segregates speech from noise by producing a binary time-frequency mask. The binary masks are then used to reconstruct clean speeches. Second, since the reconstructed clean speeches may contain more than one speaker&quot;s voice, we propose an unsupervised audio clustering approach to perform speech separation. Unreliable time-frequency (T-F) units in simultaneous streams are reconstructed using a speech prior, and cepstral features are subsequently derived for clustering. We search for two clusters exhibiting the biggest speaker difference, i.e. the trace of the between- and within-cluster scatter matrix ratio. To speed up the search process, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed. Third, after we extract the audio streams of each speaker, we go one more step. We propose to apply the latest speaker identification algorithm developed by our team for each separated voice stream. The reason to apply robust algorithms is that there may still be residual noise in the separated voice streams.",Chihwa Yung,Chief Operations Officer,(301) 315-2322,chihwa.yung@signalpro.net,Chiman Kwan,Chief Technology Officer,(240) 505-2641,chiman.kwan@signalpro.net,Stub,,,"['detection', 'noisy environment', 'framework audio', 'computational', 'speech signal', 'non-speech', 'noise', 'speech noise', 'binary time-frequency mask', 'clean speech', 'clean speech', 'unsupervised audio clustering approach', 'speech separation', 'time-frequency', 'simultaneous', 'cepstral feature', 'scatter matrix ratio', 'speed', 'search process', 'genetic algorithm', 'identification algorithm', 'team', 'voice stream', 'algorithm residual noise', 'voice stream']"

To meet the cost goals for traction motors to expand the availability of electric vehicles, substantial reductions in cost to produce the Nd-Fe-B alloy powders must be achieved as well as providing a U.S. base of supply.  Neodymium oxide (Nd2O3), the DOE specified starting material, is transformed to anhydrous neodymium chloride (NdCl3) by demonstrated low cost processing which is the feed along with iron chloride (FeCl2) and boron trichloride (BCl3) to an electrolytic fused salt cell that directly produces the ideal alloy Nd2Fe14B fine powder at a fraction of the state-of-the-art process cost.  The Nd2Fe14B is vacuum separated from the salt that is recycled to the electrolytic cell and the Nd2Fe14B powder is sintered to form a magnet without exposure to air producing a high quality magnet at low cost. The phase I demonstrated Nd2O3 could be transformed to anhydrous NdCl3 using a carbothermic reduction/chlorination demonstrated process.  The anhydrous NdCl3 was co-fed with FeCl2 and BCl3 to an electrolytic fused salt cell that electrolytically directly deposited the ideal alloy Nd2Fe14B as a very fine powder in the desirably nano size range that translates to magnets with higher energy density. The simplified flow chart that directly produces the Nd2Fe14B alloy predicts a cost significantly less than the current price of Chinese produced material. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated in Phase I.  Phase II proposes to scale-up processing utilizing neodymium oxide or lower cost carbonate to produce anhydrous NdCl3 which will be co-fed with FeCl2 and BCl3 in a scaled-up electrolytic cell to define reproducibility of producing very fine/nano particle Nd2Fe14B powder that is vacuum separated from the salt which is recycled back to the electrolytic cell in a benign environmental cycle.  The separated Nd2Fe14B alloy powder will be sintered into low cost magnets without exposure to the atmosphere.  This project establishes a U.S. source to produce Nd2Fe14B alloy powder and high quality magnets. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Substantially reducing the cost and energy in an environmentally friendly process to produce low cost Nd2Fe14B alloy powder provides the material to produce high quality permanent magnets at low cost that translates to producing more electric vehicles. The greater use of electric vehicles reduces pollution, reduces the need for oil/petroleum and the attendant advantages of reduced importing of oil.  A greater use of electric vehicles emanating from low cost permanent magnets is a benefit to the entire Nation.  The low cost Nd2Fe14B is also applicable for magnets for wind generation of electricity as well as defense applications.

According to the CDC, these parasites infect up to 2 million Americans annually, and we have developed robust sensitive qPCR tests for both infections that have been used successfully on hundreds of patients in Bangladesh and Tanzania. During  Phase I these assays were converted into a Cryptosporidium/Giardia multiplex assay that detected all known human subspecies and was workable on two major qPCR platforms (Roche LightCycler and BioRad iCycler). During Phase I we also determined the most sens itive DNA extraction procedure among the commercially available kits, and then improved the sensitivity of PCR detection further through magnetic target-specific DNA capture. This Phase II application will now finalize the target DNA extraction procedure f rom stool for highest throughput and collect validation data from the field at our site in Tanzania in order to prepare an FDA 501(k) application, which we predict will allow a strong market entry. We hypothesize that our technique will be more sensitive t han the typical gold standard Merifluor Cryptosporidium/Giardia IFA, and we will utilize a third tiebreaker PCR test to resolve any discrepant results. Secondarily, the test will also be validated on water samples versus the EPA's Giardia/Cryptosporidium m ethod #1623, given the market and need for improved tests for these protozoa on drinking and recreational water samples. The innovation of this application lies in the DNA capture extraction technology, a platform translatable to other clinical specimens b esides stool, and the concept of bringing state-of-the-art diagnostics beyond antigen detection to under-funded parasitic infections of waterborne health importance.         This Phase II application will advance our development of a Giardia/Cryptosporidiu m real time PCR kit that incorporates highly sensitive target-specific DNA extraction with a highly optimized multiplex qPCR assay.

Eye wounds are extremely painful, can cause vision loss, and may fail to heal on their own. Trauma may occur due to household cleaning agents, traumatic impact from a falling object, or removal of a contact lens. Ocular surgeries, such as cataract and refractive surgeries, are also sources for corneal injury. Delays in healing may lead to scarring and permanent visual loss. This project will lead to the first biodegradable &quot;green&quot; corneal bandage that accelerates corneal healing. The bandage resembles a contact lens. When this bandage is placed on a wounded eye it reduces inflammation and stimulates the healing process. It is made of a novel biomaterial, which can be programmed to &quot;dissolve&quot; within hours to days providing patients with a tailored product. Completed work from Phase I demonstrated the corneal bandage significantly accelerated corneal healing rate. During Phase II further development will ready the product for human clinical trials. Results from Phase II will produce the final product design, quality system implementation, and initial development of a GMP manufacturing process. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will help the 2 million Americans that sustain traumatic injuries to the cornea each year, and the 4 million Americans that undergo surgery annually leaving the cornea wounded. Such corneal wounds cause intense pain and may lead to blindness depending on the severity. This new eye bandage accelerates corneal healing and adheres to the surface of the eye to aid in alleviating pain. The bandage is inexpensive and will result in a less expensive procedure for treating cornea trauma resulting in millions in savings to the American health care system, while allowing for the expansion of the point of care environments (i.e. clinic, home use, hostile environments).

The proposed solution involves creation of an advanced 3D fabric with highly conductive pitch-based carbon fibers. 3D fabric will provide Z-direction continuity via mini thermal paths created by through-thickness fibers. Inter-panel connections will be reduced by folding one continuous sheet of fabric to form the main satellite bus. Thermal contact resistance of the smaller number of remaining inter-panel connections will be minimized using advanced fillers and fastening techniques. All surfaces will be polished and coated to expose fibers on panel faces and edges.  In Phase I, KaZaK will focus on analytical design of flat plate thermal panels, prototype fabrication and thermal testing.

Endoscopes are the major devices that are used for this purpose. It is impossible, however, to measure the actual size of the imaged objects using an endoscope that is not equipped with additional features, as the instrument magnifies object details depending on its distance from the endoscope tip, and this distance is unknown, and is constantly changing during the examination. This measurement situation changed, in 1996, when Olympus Industrial introduced a two objective measuring endoscope that produced an optical stereopair that could be used to determine distance via the triangulation method used in classical two-camera photogrammetry. The diameter of the outer shaft of this endoscope is 4.4mm, and the device is widely used in the industrial field. The medical community, however, has not embraced this device, most likely for two reasons: (i) a reduced angle of view (700) compared to the larger angle of view (more than1100) used in endoscopic visual examination; and (ii) the high cost involved in the measurement process. Diagnostic endoscopy is typically qualitative. The physicians make conclusions from observation of the tissue colors and abnormalities. High quality color reproduction devices with a wide field of view are in use. As medical diagnostics progresses, however, there are more requests for quantative measurements during endoscopy. The development of an endoscopic supportive tool with measurement capabilities, that will not interrupt the endoscopic procedure, but can rapidly provide quantative support to the diagnosis, would be valuable to medical practitioners. This tool would best be delivered through the instrumental channel of the endoscope, as are other supportive tools. The diameter of the instrumental channel is restricted, however, and a two lens probe, such as the Olympus probe, will not fit in the channel. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) is collaborating with the UCLA Medical Center and School of Engineering to develop technologies specifically focused on the fabrication of novel unique surgical tools and MEMS devices to enhance endoscope measurement capabilities. IOS has developed and proven a method of producing a stereopair using a single lens with an optically transparent tilting plate in front of the lens. UCLA researchers have fabricated and demonstrated the operability of a MEMS device incorporating an optically transparent plate. In this project, the IOS-UCLA team proposes to develop a single lens endoscopic measuring probe no more than 2.5mm in diameter. In Phase I, the team will fabricate and demonstrate a measuring endoscope probe prototype 5.5mm in diameter, based on an already fabricated tilting plate; develop measurement algorithms and software, and modify the MEMS fabrication flow process to downsize the device to the 2.5mm dimension. A precommercial prototype of the measuring endoscopic probe, ready for FDA approval, will be presented at the end of Phase II.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Requirements for quantifying the size of lesions, polyps, and other pathological parts of tissue during endoscopy diagnostics, are growing. Reliable, low cost, high accuracy tools to support endoscopy procedures with quantative data, however, do not exist. IOS, in collaboration with UCLA researchers, proposes to develop a measuring endoscopic probe, a tool that can be inserted into the instrumental channel of the endoscope, and will provide dimensional measurements of biological objects during endoscopic procedures. This novel tool will help to reduce the number of uncertainties that still exist in endoscopy diagnosis.",SANDY HONDA,,(310) 530-7130,shonda@intopsys.com,VLADIMIR RUBTSOV,,(424) 263-6316,SBIRPROPOSALS@INTOPSYS.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'Noncontact remote dimensional measurement', 'access area', 'nondestructive remote', 'visual', 'evaluation', 'industrial field', 'endoscope major device', 'actual size', 'image object', 'endoscope', 'instrument', 'object', 'distance endoscope tip', 'distance', 'examination', 'measurement situation change', 'Olympus Industrial', 'measuring', 'endoscope', 'optical stereopair use', 'distance triangulation method', 'diameter outer shaft endoscope', 'device', 'industrial field', 'device', 'endoscopic visual examination', 'cost', 'measurement process', 'diagnostic endoscopy', 'physician', 'observation', 'tissue color', 'quality', 'quantative measurement endoscopy', 'development', 'endoscopic supportive tool', 'measurement', 'capability', 'endoscopic procedure', 'quantative support', 'diagnosis', 'instrumental channel endoscope', 'supportive tool', 'ios', 'technology', 'focus fabrication', 'surgical tool mems device', 'endoscope measurement', 'capability', 'ios', 'method', 'ios-ucla team', 'single lens', 'phase', 'team', 'endoscope probe', 'measurement', 'device', 'public', 'health', 'size', 'lesion', 'pathological tissue endoscopy', 'cost', 'accuracy tool', 'endoscopy procedure', 'quantative datum', 'ios', 'measuring', 'tool insert instrumental channel endoscope', 'measurement', 'biological object', 'endoscopic procedure', 'endoscopy', 'diagnosis']"

The proposed display technology combines closed-loop HMI analysis and visual enhancement based on modern human cognitive science. It is designed for improving operator focus and situational awareness, coupled with low cognitive load symbology improvements. Specifically, the innovation in closed-loop analysis and display enhancements to reduce cognitive load and increase operator effectiveness will enable Intellisense to generate a unique HMI style guide for use by the Navy to translate into tactical code. In Phase I Intellisense will develop a concept of an HEL weapon HMI through analysis and modeling of the DED-AHEAD proposed display architecture for simulation and evaluation of closed-loop optimization of the HMI. Intellisense’s strategic partner will provide further insights for HEL system integration, leading to the feasibility demonstration of the technology that compares the baseline HEL HMI with the new DED-AHEAD enhanced HMI. Derivation of capabilities of the surrogate display hardware prototype will be demonstrated in Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense also plans to fully develop a prototype of the DED-AHEAD derived HMI concept for HEL weapon operator stations with surrogate computer hardware and displays using nontactical code emulating tactical displays.

The Raman laser is pumped by commercially available fiber laser at near-infrared wavelength. Its wavelength can be selectable by tuning the pump laserwavelength. The PBG fiber is fabricated using a new IR material developed in Phase I, which is highly transparent in the broadband infrared region. Confining hydrogen and pump light together in the hollow core of the PBG fiber can lead to much higher Raman laser conversion efficiency and low threshold. The all-fiber laser structure is compact and robust. No free-space optical components are used. It is insensitive to environmental changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, and vibration. The laser can be used for infrared countermeasures to the next generation of heat seeking missiles and for high-resolution, long-range target identification remote sensing of biological or chemical agents. In Phase II, we will produce the PBG fiber and build a prototype of the all-fiber infrared Raman laser.  BENEFIT:  The all-fiber, robust and compact infrared Raman fiber lasers can be used as infrared countermeasures (IRCM) for defense against heat seeking missiles or man-portable air defense system.

As of early 1998, at least 30 nations were known to have more than 10,000 ballistic missiles in their arsenals and the threat is growing daily. Several of these countries are also known to be pursuing development or to have developed nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities for their missiles. To counter this threat the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has sponsored the development of the Airborne Laser (ABL), which is a system centered around a high-energy chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) carried aboard a modified Boeing 747-400F freighter. Airborne Laser (ABL) will locate and track missiles in the boost phase of their flight, then accurately point and fire the high-energy laser, destroying enemy missiles near their launch areas. This proposal addresses critical new technology for the ABL tracking function contained within the Active Ranging System (ARS). The currently deployed ARS utilizes a CO2 laser rangefinder to generate both a range and instantaneous radial velocity of the missile with respect to the airborne platform. Although the technology that is employed is mature and highly functional, the emission of the CO2 laser at 11.15 ƒYm is not eyesafe, and is therefore hazardous to humans. Eyesafe operation of the laser rangefinder is a goal for the Next Generation Active Ranging System (NGARS), which will utilize a transmitter that operates between 1.4 and 1.6 mm and newly developed InGaAs avalanche photo-diodes (APD) that are sensitive in this region. Not only is eyesafe operation important for ABL; it is becoming a standard requirement on new laser rangefinder and laser radar (ladar) systems.

In response to the need for a flexible gateway, Maxentric and The Cooper Union have partnered to propose an extensible software framework that can generate a communications gateway to translate information across different networks. The technology is codenamed the Cognitive Communications Gateway Engine (CCGE).

To address the problem, The proposed research is focused on novel artificial intelligence techniques,such as fuzzy logic, neural nets, and wavelets to make NCTR techniques perform better. Although artificial intelligence techniques have been investigated for single sensors, they have not been explored extensively when there is data available from avariety of sensors.  Topics to be investigated also involve the application of such techniques as Pattern Recognition, Decision Theory, and Optimization Theory.  Current NCTR techniques work quite well but only under constrained battlefield conditions.The intent is to use a data fused algorithm using some of these techniques as a basis from which to begin the development of an algorithm that is much less susceptible to battlefield conditions.  Artificial Intelligence techniques have had success in thecontrol field.  The approach is to build upon the application of those techniques and to adapt to the extent possible the manner in which those techniques were applied.  Once the criteria and logic flow have been determined, the design of the algorithmwill occur.If the proposed research is successful, it can have tremendous impact on numerous weapon systems that have a need for Non-Cooperative Target Recognition/Identification.  The ability to achieve NCTR has been sorely need by all DOD services.  Ithas the potential to give the battlefield commander better control over his resources and could reduce logistics considerably.  With this technique, the battlefield commander will have a capability to determine which of his resources is the most applicablefor any threat engagement scenario.  This can reduce operating and support costs significantly.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This SBIR Fast-Track project will develop an innovative non-invasive cloud connected device for hemodynamic-guided therapy to improve outcomes in Heart Failure (HF) patients, validated through a multi- center clinical trial to support FDA 510(k) clearance. The standard telemonitoring interventions involving objective monitoring of blood pressure, weight, electrocardiograms, or rhythm strips for review, have not demonstrated reduction with respect to readmission for any reason or death of any cause within 180 days after enrollment. Invasive devices have demonstrated that ambulatory pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) hemodynamic measurement allow more effective HF management leading to fewer hospitalizations. Thus, given the clinical and economic impact of HF hospitalizations, and in view of the risk and cost of invasive monitoring there is a need for non-invasive, affordable, accurate, absolute and actionable hemodynamic measurement methods that can monitor HF patients in the clinic and at home. Providing an effective method for early detection of congestion and guided therapy intervention to avoid hospitalization. The ability of a device to allow the management of HF patient across the continuity of care from the emergency department, to in- patient, to out-patient clinic, and to the home, would be of tremendous value. Towards this goal of HF management, Aventusoft has developed a novel non-invasive medical device (HEMOTAG) enabling specific measurements of hemodynamics, anywhere, anytime by anyone. Aventusoft has completed multiple Institutional Review Board approved clinical studies to demonstrate the major clinical advancement. Phase I and II activities will focus on larger multi-center clinical studies, enhancing the HEMOTAG technology for hemodynamic guided therapy to improve outcomes in heart failure patients, reducing HF hospitalization, mortality, morbidity, and improving quality of care through remote monitoring and timely intervention. Resulting in FDA 510(k) indications of use, for HEMOTAG guided treatment for HF patients. The development of a non- invasive, accurate and easy-to-use solution that can provide actionable targets measurements without requiring an echocardiogram imaging or right heart catheterization, will have great potential not only for HF management but for many other etiologies as well. Aventusoft’s HEMOTAG provides a complement or replacement for expensive devices currently required for measuring the pulmonary artery pressures. The HEMOTAG device can enable reliable, accurate, absolute, actionable and easy-to-use application by healthcare professionals and by patients at home, for the early detection of congestive exacerbations due to fluid overload. It overcomes the limitations of cost, size, accessibility and availability of skilled personnel requirements of existing devices. HEMOTAG verification and validation would be completed during the Phase II. Followed by commercialization in Florida and nationwide, based on the business partnerships and clinical collaborations established to help create a commercially successful product.8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Overall this project provides direct relevance to public health by facilitating new insights through the development of a cloud connected hemodynamic-guided HF management centered around the “HEMOTAG” transducer accompanied by an app on a personal smartphone. Resulting in FDA 510(k) cleared device with indications of use, for HEMOTAG guided treatment for HF patients. The novel device will significantly impact the current known methods for detection, monitoring, prevention and treatment of heart failure, and support evidence-based clinical practice.

On one hand, costs must be reduced by factors of many.  But on the other hand, there are strong pressures for ever improved performance.The first and most obvious way to reduce space systems costs is to reduce spacecraft size and mass so that smaller, cheaper launch vehicles (e.g. Delta or Atlas) may be used.  However, in the case of optical systems, increased performance usually implies directly an increased size of the payload.  Development and demonstration of novel and unique optical-structural concepts to resolve this inherent dichotomy is the subject of WJSA's SBIR proposal.

Increased MC dispersion and stakeholder distribution will inherently increase demand for effective collaboration tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), mediated through advanced technology to ensure both situational awareness and common ground. Significant advances to augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)—collectively extended reality (XR)—technologies, mobile computing power, and US Army expeditionary network connectivity has created an opportunity for MC collaboration to extend beyond traditional methods (e.g., voice and video teleconferencing). To take advantage of these opportunities and provide MC Commanders and staff with enhanced SA and common ground to drive effective distributed and dispersed collaboration, Charles River Analytics designed, prototyped, and demonstrated feasibility of Virtual Environment Collaboration Tools for Operational Readiness (VECTOR) under a Phase I effort. VECTOR provides a network and application architecture designed to support dispersed and distributed MC execution through synchronized virtual collaboration environments (VCEs). Our Phase I results include: (1) an open and extensible software architecture to support synchronous multiuser virtual MC using a Reachback Server, Expeditionary Servers, and Client applications; (2) a contextually-configured 3D geospatial common operating picture supporting XR head-mounted displays (HMDs), Android mobile devices, and Windows PCs; (3) prototype virtual MC collaboration mechanisms; and (4) a performance-based evaluation of technical feasibility. Based on the success of our Phase I effort, Charles River Analytics proposes a Phase II effort to refine, enhance, apply, and evaluate a full-scope VECTOR system, and pursue transition and commercialization into relevant operational MC environments. Our Phase II prototype will consist of effective XR visualization, human-computer interaction (HCI), and collaboration capabilities to support selected distributed MC tasks. VECTOR provides foundational capabilities to improve situational awareness (SA) and performance by enabling enhanced collaboration, compressed decision cycles, and enhanced ability to discern and resolve the spatiotemporal relationships of a battlespace. By facilitating integrated visualization of multi-domain elements and remote collaboration combined with intelligent denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) degradation, VECTOR is ideal to support future multi-domain operations. To ensure the development of our full-scope VECTOR prototype is operationally grounded and achieves TRL 6, we will identify relevant information and decision support solutions that will benefit from integration with XR collaboration capabilities, such that we can tailor the VECTOR approach to achieve technology transition",Erica Hartnett,,(617) 491-3474,ehartnett@cra.com,Arthur Wollocko,,(617) 491-3474,awollocko@cra.com,,,,"['Mission Command', 'legacy command', 'post', 'mc dispersion stakeholder', 'distribution', 'collaboration', 'technique', 'procedure', 'technology', 'situational awareness', 'mobile computing power', 'voice video teleconferencing', 'SA', 'collaboration', 'prototype', 'feasibility Virtual Environment', 'Collaboration tool', 'vector', 'network', 'phase result', 'multiuser virtual mc use', 'Server', 'client application', 'operating picture', 'head-mounted display', 'android mobile device', 'Windows pc', 'prototype', 'mechanism', 'performance-based evaluation', 'enhance', 'full-scope VECTOR system', 'commercialization', 'mc environment', 'phase', 'xr visualization', 'human-computer interaction', 'collaboration capability', 'mc task', 'VECTOR', 'situational awareness', 'performance', 'collaboration', 'decision cycle', 'spatiotemporal relationship battlespace', 'integrated visualization', 'multi-domain element', 'remote', 'VECTOR', 'multi-domain operation', 'development', 'information', 'integration', 'collaboration', 'capability', 'VECTOR', 'technology transition']"

While a delay does not always indicate an underlying condition, developmental delays are markers for more severe developmental conditions including autism, intellectual disability, and speech and language disorders. The tremendous adaptability of the brain in the first three years of life means that early treatment of  delays leads to improved outcomes, whereas later intervention is less effective.1-3 In order to provide treatment to improve children&#039;s outcomes, early identification of delays and sensory impairments by pediatric primary care providers during their first three years of a child&#039;s life is  critical. There is a tremendous need for and interest in early identification of children at risk fr development problems, with vast attention to this topic by leading organizations for pediatric health. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released updated recommendations onDevelopmental Surveillance and Screening in the Medical Home in 20065 and Autism Screening in 20076; the NICHD emphasize the need for Early Identification and Interventions for Infants and Young Children at Risk for Mental Retardation; and AHRQ has issueda Special Emphasis Notice for research on diagnostic errors (including delay in diagnosis) in the ambulatory care setting.7 Two key gaps noted in a recent AHRQ recommendation statement8 included the needed for screening strategies in diverse populations, and translating effective, evidence-based screening approaches for use in primary care practices. Screening tools are available for general developmental screening, but with no consensus on the specific screens to use in practice. While screening is being increasingly adopted by pediatricians, they often remain uncomfortable discussing the results with parents. This program addresses the need for educational materials that:   bring together information to assist pediatric primary care providers  in choosingtools from among those provided in the 2006 AAP recommendations5;   provide guidance on implementation of screening in practice; and   assist them to effectively communicate the purpose and results of these screens in practice. The key goals of this program directly address some of the difficulties involved in implementing developmental screening in practice. This resource will inform providers about the importance and challenges of conducting developmental screening; assist providers in understanding and communicating those results to parents, and identifying and acknowledging cultural considerations in screening strategies and delivery of results. The specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To develop the full clinical content for a CME/CE program that will focus on implementation of the use, benefits, and limitations of development screening tools in primary care and communication of results. Specific Aim 2: Complete the web based CME/CE program based on the clinical content outline and findings from the PhaseI grant, including culturally and socioeconomically diverse pediatric populations. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a rigorous evaluation of the program with pediatric primary care providers.

Of the 1,350 Cs irradiators in the U.S., approximately 650 are used for irradiating transfusion blood bags to inactivate leukocytes and thereby prevent transfusion-associated  graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD), a gruesome condition in which  active  donor  leukocytes  attack  the internal  organs  of immuno-suppressed  patients,  with fatality rates of over 90%.   Replacement of blood irradiators with 60Co sources has been attempted, but has been unsuccessful.   X-rays are the obvious alternative to isotopes.  Previous attempts at using x-rays for blood irradiation, however, have been unsuccessful due to their reliance on inappropriate sources.  Point-source X-ray tubes are not meant to be operated for several minutes, the time need to deliver the FDA-recommended dose of 25 Gy (min 15 Gy, max 50 Gy) to the blood bags. Stellarray proposes the development and deployment of a new type of self-contained blood irradiator (SCBI) to replace isotope irradiators.   The heart of the SCBI is Stellarray’s patented flat panel x-ray source (FPXS), which is designed for continuous operation and is ideally suited for blood and other irradiation systems.  In the FPXS, arrays of cathodes below a top exit window emit e-beam showers at high voltage to a large metal anode target assembly.  This anode, the top window and side walls form the vacuum enclosure of the source.   SCBI will be about the size of a microwave oven, compared  to the refrigerator-sized  irradiators  now available,  weigh  between  200 and 500 lbs. (as opposed to 1.5 – 2 tons), be operable with 110 AC power for the small and medium sized models and with 220 single phase for the large conveyor model; require no external cooling, and be extremely reliable.  Stellarray will develop and offer SCBI in three sizes:  small (for two 400 ml bags or similar volumes), medium (four 400 ml bag equivalent), and large (three pairs of panels, with either tray or conveyor  belt operation).   Multiple  interlocks,  self shielding  of the sources, and lead wall linings ensure  safe  operation.    All  three  models  will  have  dose  rates  > 8  Gy/min;  closed  loop  oil  heat exchangers; less than 10% dose variation in x, y or z directions; operation up to 160 kV; >4,000 hours lifetime; and full compliance with radiation safety standards.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  SCBI  can  become  a substantial  business  since  it  has  been designed  with user needs clearly  in mind.     It is well-suited for use in crowded blood banks and hospitals and requires no special security measures or changes to room utilities.    It will be priced attractively, for a substantially lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives.    The use of the right source will make it highly reliable, so it can displace isotope irradiators. ",Mark Eaton,Mr.,(512) 997-7781,eaton@stellar-micro.com,Mark Eaton,Mr.,(512) 997-7781,eaton@stellar-micro.com,,,,"['National Academy Sciences issue report', 'self-containe', 'production cesium chloride salt', 'dispersal device', 'transfusion blood bag inactivate', 'host disease', 'gruesome condition', 'attack', 'fatality rate', 'replacement blood irradiator', 'alternative isotope', 'x-ray blood irradiation', 'source', 'point-source x-ray tube', 'blood bag', 'development', 'replace isotope irradiator', 'patent flat panel x-ray source', 'design', 'continuous operation', 'blood irradiation system', 'array cathode exit', 'e-beam shower', 'metal', 'anode', 'target', 'anode', 'source', 'size', 'microwave oven', 'refrigerator-sized   irradiator', 'external cooling', 'size', 'medium', 'tray conveyor   belt operation', 'source', 'lead wall lining', 'operation', 'rate', 'loop', 'heat exchanger', 'operation', 'radiation safety standard', 'business', 'design', 'user', 'special security', 'cost', 'isotope irradiator']"

Surgery is currently the standard of care for early stage lung cancer. A critical challenge is to reliably identify small, early-stage tumors and resect them with sufficient margins (distance between the edge of tumor and the line of resection). Too close a margin is associated with a higher incidence of recurrence and death. To address this challenge, this team developed a new surgical procedure called image-guided video thoracoscopic surgery (iVATS), in which the surgeon localizes and resects small lung nodules by marking them percutaneously using a fiducial marker, a small passive metal tag called T-bar, placed under C-arm CT image-guidance. A novel navigation technology, NaviSci™, was developed to aid in identifying and removing lung tumors by using an active sensing nodule marker, called J- Bar, that is placed in the lung just next to the tumor and can track the tumor position in real-time and help assess margins. However, use of the J-Bar requires either intraoperative imaging or approximate visual positioning of very small tumors that may not be visible during surgery from the lung surface. Navigation Sciences is now developing a tumor marker that can be positioned with a bronchoscope and does not require CT imaging during surgery. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to develop and validate the NaviSci-EndoMarkerTM (called EndoMarker hereafter) to accurately localize small lung tumors. The EndoMarker will be positioned adjacent to the tumor with a bronchoscope based on navigation planned using diagnostic CT images. This will simplify the clinical workflow and make this procedure accessible to hospitals that do not have advanced intra-operative imaging technologies. Aim 1 is to design and develop the bronchoscopic EndoMarker. Aim 2 is to validate the workflow for deploying the EndoMarker, mechanical stability, and electrical isolation of the EndoMarker in a 3D printed lung phantom, ex vivo porcine lungs and 2 live pigs. This STTR project is a collaboration between Navigation Sciences and ongoing collaborators at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA). The proposed Randamp;D project is significant since it addresses an important problem of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function, which could benefit thousands of patients each year. The novelty lies in the design of the EndoMarker, which will allow the J-Bar marker to be placed accurately via a bronchoscope so that it can readily localize small tumors and define their margins during surgery. Successful completion of this project will result in an innovative disruptive product that will provide surgical guidance to ensure sufficient resection of early-stage lung cancer with acceptable margins without any additional imaging equipment at the medical center.NARRATIVE This project will develop a novel surgical marking device to localize small lung tumors so they can be found and removed, with safe margins, in surgical procedures that preserve healthy lung tissue and function. The marking device can be positioned before surgery and will not require the use of advanced imaging technologies during surgery. Because modern screening methods identify lung cancer at an early stage when the tumors are very small and easier to remove, this tool will benefit thousands of patients each year.",ALAN LUCAS,,(617) 525-6240,alan@alandlucas.com,JAYENDER JAGADEESAN,,(617) 525-6240,jjagadeesan@partners.org,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,,,"['abstract', 'long-term', 'goal project', 'navigation system', 'margin', 'real-time surgery', 'lung cancer', 'surgery', 'standard care', 'lung cancer', 'tumor resect sufficient margin', 'distance edge tumor line resection', 'margin', 'team', 'surgical procedure', 'image-guided video thoracoscopic surgery', 'lung nodule', 'fiducial marker', 'small passive metal tag t-bar', 'C-arm ct image-guidance', 'navigation technology', 'lung tumor', 'active sensing nodule', 'j- Bar', 'lung tumor', 'real-time', 'margin', 'J-Bar', 'visual', 'lung surface', 'navigation', 'ct imaging surgery', 'phase sttr project', 'small lung tumor', 'tumor bronchoscope base navigation plan', 'workflow procedure', 'hospital', 'intra-operative imaging technology', 'design', 'mechanical stability', 'electrical isolation', 'lung 2 live', 'collaboration', 'Navigation', 'problem', 'lung nodule', 'lung function', 'J-Bar', 'margin surgery', 'disruptive product', 'surgical guidance', 'lung cancer', 'margin', 'imaging equipment', 'lung tumor', 'safe margin', 'surgical procedure', 'lung tissue', 'device', 'imaging technology surgery', 'modern screening method', 'lung cancer', 'tool']"

The long-term objective of       the proposal (Phase II) is to utilize the novel red fluorophores in gene             expression assays to detect multiple messenger RNA (mRNA) targets in a high          throughput screening (HTS) format for pharmaceutical drug discovery. Such an         oligonucleotide based, simultaneous multi-target detection system will greatly       facilitate monitoring expression of genes involved in cancer and other diseases      and drug discovery that requires a high throughput screening format.                                                                                                      The technological innovation of the proposed research lies in the novel design       and successful synthesis of a series of polycyclic aromatic compounds which          will result in red fluorescent dyes that possess photo-stability, high quantum       yields, and large Stokes' shifts. Developing inexpensive, fast, facile and           ultrasensitive multi-target gene expression assays will contribute to the            technological advancement of molecular research and clinical diagnostics. This       will be a proposal for a Phase II grant application. Chromagen has already           demonstrated its ability to develop assays to detect two targets in the same         micro-well in a high throughput screening format. Developing a triple target         gene expression assay will not only enhance the gene discovery process, but          will also expedite the identification of lead drug candidates in the                 pharmaceutical industry.

Accurate array heading and position estimates of the receive aperture are required for the localization of active returns.

The proposed fuel is a Cer-Cer made of mixed uranium-refractory carbide particles such as (U, Zr)C or (U, Zr, Nb)C dispersed in a refractory carbide matrix such as ZrC. For efficient operation in NTR applications for Isp of 1000 sec. or more, a fuel temperature of 3000 K or greater is necessary.  Various fuel materials have been tested for NTR applications with most based on carbide fuel technology because of their improved thermal properties enabling the design of very small, high power density cores.  Fuel designs from dispersed microspheres in graphite, to composite mixed carbides with graphite, to solid solution mixed carbides have been tested.  Fuels bearing graphite are not tenable because of the high reactivity of free carbon with the hot hydrogen propellant.  Solid solution, mixed carbides are most often brittle but otherwise perform well under the high temperature flowing hot hydrogen environment.  The life limiting phenomenon for their use in NTR applications is the loss of uranium due to vaporization from the fuel surface at temperatures in excess of 2800 K.

The basis for the system is carbon nanotube (CNT) enhancements embedded within composite laminates in conjunction with direct write (DW) electrodes patterned on a flexible abrasion-proof substrate. CNT provide improved delamination &amp; fracture toughness to the material, but also introduce multifunctional capabilities by virtue of their excellent thermal and electrical conductivity. Impact detection can be achieved by observing changes in local resistivity. Ice-detection is based on effective heat capacity, where power is applied to the CNT through DW electrodes for a brief period, and the temperature rise is recorded with DW thermocouples. The slope of that rise can been well correlated to the thickness of ice present on the surface. For de-icing (melting) and anti-icing (prevention of ice formation) a resistive heating principal will be used. A sparse network of DW electrodes will be applied to an abrasion-resistant layer and bonded to the CNT-enhanced composite, and when voltage is applied the CNT will heat due to their small but finite resistance value. Due to their high thermal conductivity, heat will be distributed relatively evenly throughout the aerosurface.",Seth Kessler,President,(617) 661-5616,skessler@metisdesign.com,Seth Kessler,President,(617) 661-5616,skessler@metisdesign.com,Stub,,,"['Design', 'development', 'intelligent-aerosurface system', 'ice-detection', 'de-icing', 'anti-icing', 'rotor-blade', 'carbon nanotube', 'abrasion-proof substrate', 'fracture toughness material', 'multifunctional capability', 'electrical conductivity', 'impact', 'detection', 'local resistivity', 'ice-detection base effective', 'heat capacity', 'temperature', 'ice', 'surface', 'anti-icing', 'prevention ice formation', 'abrasion-resistant layer bond cnt-enhanced composite', 'voltage', 'cnt heat small finite resistance value', 'thermal conductivity', 'heat']"

However, comprehensive relay logic testing may not be done before issuing the relay settings to field. At some utilities, RTDS relay testing is done for standard logic prior to issuing files to field but there are often changes with brown field installations, so specific applications for each project are issued untested. At other utilities testing may be left entirely to the field. Therefore, relay testing is typically performed in the field at the very end stages of a project. The field test may not be comprehensive either due to shortage of time or abundance of scenarios to be tested. The settings (along with logic in them) produced in such conditions pave the way to misoperation that present hazard to the public and utility workers. We propose to develop a Virtual Logic Test Software (VLTS) which an engineer can utilize to develop and interactively test the custom logic such that the engineer will confirm the desired operation on a simulation one-line before issuing the settings file. VLTS will enable testing of all the relay functions rather than a few common limited scenarios in a fraction of time it would take on RTDS or field test. Using VLTS, electric utilities will also be able investigate inaccuracies in relays that are already in service to prevent a potential false operation waiting to occur. By the end of Phase II, user will be able to directly import logic from the relay setting files (i.e. SEL’s .rdb files) into VLTS. Once converted in graphical format, the user will then be able to analyze individual bits and/or outputs in detail as well as the operation on a simulation one-line to verify the proper operation of the relays in the station. We limit our scope in Phase I to SEL Relays because our first potential customer, PPL Electric Utilities, utilizes SEL relays. We will expand the software capabilities, other relays manufacturers and fault study programs in Phase II. The proposed tool will provide a myriad of benefits to the public: Customers will experience no blackouts caused by inaccurate or incomplete relay logic. Power utilities themselves will have significant savings because of not having the blackout, but more importantly not having to fix the improper logic or the damage it may have caused. This in turn will reduce transmission and distribution cost to the end customer. Ability to virtually test existing installations will enable the power utility to identify relays that have erroneous logic, waiting to cause a misoperation.",Baris Kovan,,(347) 536-4691,bkovan@hpowere.com,Baris Kovan,,(347) 536-4691,bkovan@hpowere.com,,,,"['custom relay logic', 'operation', 'substation', 'comprehensive relay logic testing', 'rtds relay testing', 'application project', 'issue', 'testing', 'relay testing', 'field end stage project', 'field test', 'abundance scenario test', 'logic', 'condition', 'hazard public', 'Virtual Logic Test Software', 'interactively test', 'custom logic', 'operation', 'simulation', 'testing', 'relay function', 'RTDS field test', 'use vlts', 'electric utility', 'relay service', 'potential', 'false operation', 'import logic relay setting file', 'individual', 'output', 'operation', 'simulation', 'operation', 'relay station', 'customer', 'Electric Utilities', 'relay', 'relay manufacturer fault study', 'tool', 'public', 'customer', 'relay logic', 'transmission', 'distribution', 'cost', 'end customer', 'relay erroneous logic']"

Archer Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Archer) and the Roskamp Institute have jointly developed A2-lowering drugs which indirectly inhibit BACE and reduce amyloid accumulation whilst preserving cognitive function in transgenic models of the disease. The lead series is based on a calcium channel blocking drug, nilvadipine, for which preliminary data suggests efficacy in delaying cognitive decline and in preventing the transition from mild cognitive impairment to AD. The potential efficacy of nilvadipine has been demonstrated in a Phase I/lla trial completed by Archer in Europe and supporting clinical data from independent studies. Despite this, and a wealth of preclinical and safety data, there are concerns that increasing doses of nilvadipine to improve efficacy will be limited by its anti-hypertensive effects. Therefore, we have examined the non anti-hypertensive (-)-nilvadipine enantiomer in preclinical models and have shown that it also lowers A2/amyloid levels in acute paradigms in transgenic models of the disease.  In advancing this form of nilvadipine as a lead compound there are critical data required for the development of clinical trials. Although racemic nilvadipine is known to concentrate in the brain in man, key factors that will determine the relative brain concentrations of (-)-nilvadipine that can be achieved in man are: a) Greater [times three] metabolism of (-)-nilvadipine vs. (+)-nilvadipine in man; b) Increased AUCbrain/ AUCplasma ratios for (-)-nilvadipine vs. racemic nilvadipine [3:1] in rodents and; c) Much lower [100 fold reduced] vasodilatory effects of (-)-nilvadipine vs. (+)-nilvadipine.  This phase I proposal will address the following issues: Aim 1 will correlate plasma levels (PK) of (-)- nilvadipine with brain PK and the impact on A2 levels (PD) in transgenic mouse models of AD. It will also compare the impact of acute vs. chronic delivery profiles on brain PK and PD in the same models. Finally, the impact of increasing doses of (-)-nilvadipine on brain PK/PD will be compared to racemic nilvadipine and the highest non-toxicdose determined and basic toxicology data gathered. Aim 2 will explore the impact of 6 months of treatment with (i) (-)-nilvadipine compared to racemic nilvadipine at the highest non-toxic dose of the latter, and (ii) the highest non-toxic (-)-nilvadipinedose, in a transgenic model of AD with pathological and behavioral outcomes.  This phase I proposal is intended as a prelude to a phase II plan to delineate toxicology parameters, synthetic and formulation strategies (both of which are already developed tonon-GMP levels by Archer) with a view to an IND filing on (-)-nilvadipine for clinical trials for use in AD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects over 27 million people worldwide and thisrate is expected to double by year 2050. In the United States, Medicare and Medicaid costs for AD amount to over  140 billion dollars per year and the burden on Public Health is anticipated to increase sharply as the population ages. Currently, there are no effective disease modifying therapeutics for AD and we wish to develop a novel derivative of nilvadipine which demonstrates encouraging preclinical data in models of the disease.",DANIEL PARIS,,(941) 755-6644,dparis@rfdn.org,DANIEL PARIS,,(941) 755-6644,dparis@rfdn.org,Stub,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'Alzheimer&#039;s Disease', 'ad', 'drug', 'cognitive function', 'transgenic model disease', 'preliminary datum', 'delay', 'cognitive impairment', 'phase', 'clinical datum', 'study', 'wealth preclinical safety datum', 'anti-hypertensive effect', 'non anti-hypertensive (-)-nilvadipine enantiomer', 'preclinical model', 'level', 'acute paradigm transgenic model disease', 'lead compound', 'critical datum', 'development', 'clinical trial', 'brain', 'man', 'aucplasma ratio', 'rodent', 'vasodilatory effect', 'phase', 'proposal', 'issue', 'plasma', 'brain pk', 'impact', 'level', 'impact', 'chronic delivery profile', 'brain pk pd model', 'impact', '(-)-nilvadipine brain', 'non-toxicdose', 'toxicology', 'impact', 'treatment', 'non-toxic dose', 'transgenic model', 'pathological', 'proposal', 'phase', 'toxicology', 'synthetic formulation strategy', 'public', 'health', 'ad', 'cost', 'Public Health', 'disease', 'preclinical datum model disease']"

approach to HIV vaccination using clade C immunogens  With a D L vaccine  a series of progressively evolved Env immunogens are used to drive development of a broadly neutralizing antibody  bnAb  response  which is important because of its ability to prevent the establishment of latent reservoirs and viral persistence  No vaccine has yet achieved such a response  but studies of naturally infected humans have shown that in patients in whom a transmitted founder  T F  Env has stimulated an unmutated common ancestor  UCA  for bnAb  the co evolution of virus and B cells can lead to somatic mutations that generate bnAb  The GeoVax directed lineage vaccine is designed to reproduce the series of mutations in Env that led to development of bnAb to the CD  binding site  CD bs  in one well studied clade C infected patient  Duke CHAVI patient      The vaccines to be tested include four recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara  rMVA  viral vaccines  each expressing non infectious Virus Like Particles  VLP   and two recombinant gp    protein vaccines  The MVA expressed VLPs display Env in a native conformation  while the gp   s are potent at boosting MVA elicited Ab responses  The vaccines will be produced and then tested in rhesus macaques  use of the rhesus model is essential because the rhesus germline sequence for the UCA for bnAb to the CD bs is orthologous to the human UCA  Two different regimens will be tested  In the D L regimen  animals will be immunized with four different rMVA vaccines expressing Env proteins from sequential nodes for the elicitation of bnAb to the CD bs in patient      the rMVA immunizations will be followed by two immunizations with gp    vaccine corresponding to the most evolved Env  In the T F regimen  animals will be immunized with rMVAs and gp   s containing only the T F sequence  Serum samples will be taken from the animals throughout the study  at time points designed to capture peak and contracted responses  The sera will be tested for magnitude  specificity  and breadth of elicited binding antibody  bAb  and neutralizing antibody  nAb   ELISAs will be performed with gp    and gp    antigens to demonstrate the overall magnitude and subunit specificity of the immune response and also with antigens specifically designed to quantify immune responses to the CD  binding site  CD bs   Testing for nAb will be performed by our collaborator  Dr  David Montefiori  The nAb testing will determine the magnitude and breadth of the nAb response and will determine the CD bs specificity of elicited nAb  GeoVax will also test elicited Ab for avidity  a potential correlate of protection  Analysis of the data will allow GeoVa to characterize the immune responses and to determine whether the new vaccine design successfully elicited a bnAb response  whether the protein boost increased bnAb titer  and whether the D L approach improved responses relative to the T F immunizations  If the D L is successful at broadening the neutralizing Ab response  it will be advance in clinical testing  If te D L approach does not broaden the nAb response  the simpler T F vaccine will be advanced into the clinic PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  This project addresses the unmet need for an HIV vaccine capable of raising a broadly neutralizing antibody response  which is important to prevent HIV from infecting a personandapos s cells and entering a latent state in which it is invisible to the immune system  Included in the project are the production and animal testing of six vaccine products  four recombinant viral vaccines and two recombinant protein vaccines   designed to be used in sequence to drive the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies  This project is an important test of a new and innovative approach to HIV prevention and will advance novel vaccines towards the clinic,MARK REYNOLDS,,(678) 770-9661,mreynolds@geovax.com,ARBAN DOMI,,(678) 384-7220,adomi@geovax.com,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'lineage',

This proton-conducting electrolyte exhibits excellent conductivity (gt;0.02 S-cm) and thereby enables ultrafast and efficient propellants production and power generation. The reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) operate in electrolysis mode, converting H2O into H2 and O2 via H2O electrolysis or directly co-converting CO2 and H2O into CH4 and O2. These chemicals can be used as the Lunar and Martian propellants. When additional electricity is needed, it functions as a fuel cell in its reversed mode to produce electricity and water. PCECs display excellent fuel flexibility and contaminants tolerance and thus can directly produce and use multiple propellants including H2, CH4, kerosene, and O2.The Team will demonstrate a novel tubular cell architecture by leveraging the capabilities at SPS. This effort will be the first time in the U.S. that PCECs are translated from planar form to tubular cells; this represents a significant achievement in and of itself.

Reduced turbine weight has a cascading effect on total airborne system mass, allowing a significantly smaller, lower cost buoyant structure to be used to access high altitude winds. At heights up to 2,000 feet winds are strong and consistent, allowing for the production of low-cost, reliable power at a broad array of sites. High altitude winds have over five times the energy potential of ground winds accessed by tower-mounted turbines, opening the potential for a major new renewable energy resource to be harnessed. In addition, the containerized deployment of airborne wind turbines has the potential to expand wind development to sites that are not feasible today, including sites that are remote or have weak ground-level winds. Overall, the technology holds the potential to significantly lower energy costs and improve reliability for remote industrial, community, and military customers and represents a major step forward in unlocking the abundant high-altitude wind resource to help in the global pursuit of greater adoption of renewable energy sources. This SBIR Phase II project will focus on reducing the total weight of the wind turbine system. Turbine weight is one of the most critical cost drivers of buoyant airborne wind energy systems. For each kilogram removed from the turbine, an additional kilogram can be removed from the inflatable shell and tethers, resulting in a significantly smaller and lower cost system. The lightest commercially available small- to medium-sized wind turbine weighs 31.1 kilograms per kilowatt of capacity, which is too heavy for an economically-viable airborne turbine. By incorporating a compact, modular architecture, a lightweight permanent magnet direct-drive (PMDD) generator and high-strength composite materials, the proposed Phase II research effort aims to double the power density of traditional medium size turbines, making the proposed system suitable for use in an airborne application, while maintaining a high level of reliability and cost performance.",Ben Glass,,(559) 245-2771,ben.glass@altaerosenergies.com,Ben Glass,,(559) 245-2771,ben.glass@altaerosenergies.com,Stub,,,"['Small Business Innovation Research', 'modular wind', 'energy system', 'turbine weight cascade', 'airborne system mass', 'structure', 'wind', 'foot wind', 'production', 'low-cost', 'array site', 'wind', 'time energy potential', 'ground wind', 'potential', 'energy resource harness', 'wind', 'wind', 'development', 'site', 'site', 'remote', 'ground-level', 'technology', 'potential', 'reliability remote', 'industrial', 'military customer', 'high-altitude', 'wind', 'resource help', 'global', 'total weight wind', 'turbine system', 'cost', 'energy system', 'medium-sized', 'wind', 'compact', 'modular architecture', 'lightweight permanent magnet direct-drive', 'phase', 'medium size', 'system', 'application', 'reliability', 'cost', 'performance']"

These soils are polluting adjacent water and land resources that, in turn, pose serious threats to human and environmental health. On the Navajo Nation alone, there are over 500 abandoned uranium mining sites and 12.8% of tested water sources exceed national drinking water standards. Uranium is also a challenge for modern mining operations as it is often present as a contaminant in mineral processing activities targeting other metals. In addition to uranium, rare earth elements (REE) are also often found as contaminants in coal and some hard- rock mining operations. Due to volatile international markets and Chinese domination of market supply, there is interest in developing alternative REE sources domestically due to the importance of REE to consumer electronics, renewable energy technologies, and national defense. Despite expressed need from the mining industry and federal regulators, technology that is both inexpensive and specific to uranium and REE is lacking. Through Phase I research, GlycoSurf has demonstrated two technologies capable of the selective removal of uranium and REE from complex mining solutions. The first is an ion flotation process wherein GlycoSurf’s propriety surfactants complex with target metals in aerated treatment solutions. Metals are separated from the bulk solutions as the metal-surfactant complex attaches to air bubbles rising to the solution surface for collection as a metal-concentrate foam. The second technology is an adsorbent material generated by functionalizing solid media with GlycoSurf’s proprietary surfactants. In this Phase II project, GlycoSurf’s objective is to demonstrate the commercial potential of these technologies for large water treatment applications by: 1) up-scaling reactor size, 2) developing treatment processes for continuous flow operations and testing, and 3) synthesizing more cost-effective glycolipids. With the University of Arizona and Wayne State University as research partners, GlycoSurf will accomplish this project through 4 aims. Currently, ion flotation has successfully been demonstrated in small-volume batch operation. Aim 1 will develop and up-scale a continuous ion flotation process using real-world metalliferous solutions supplied by BHP mining company and the U.S. Department of Energy. Aim 2 will focus on up-scaling production of rhamnolipid-functionalized adsorbent materials and developing a treatment process that will be challenged using real-world mining solutions. The need to reduce materials costs of GlycoSurf surfactants will be the focus of Aim 3. In this aim, GlycoSurf will focus on cost reductions through: 1) streamlining the synthesis process, 2) use of alternate starting materials, and 3) increasing the scale of production to realize economy-of-scale savings. Aim 4 with examine the economic feasibility and commercial potential of technology developments in this Phase II project using a techno-economic approach.Contamination of soil and water by uranium and other metals as the result of current and legacy mining operations is a widespread problem that poses serious risks to human and ecosystem health. GlycoSurf, the University of Arizona, and Wayne State University propose using green environmentally-friendly glycolipid surfactants for the recovery of toxic and precious metals, including uranium and rare earth elements, from mining-impacted waters using two promising technologies: 1) ion flotation, and 2) glycolipid-functionalized sorbents.

Calle Cesar Chavez, Suite 203",,Santa Barbara,CA,93103,"During Phase I, Computational Sensors Corporation (CSC) will develop improved methods for discriminating among targets using an optimal wavelet filter bank architecture.    Specifically, CSC will evaluate best basis search methods for choosing the optimalwavelet filters for target discrimination.  Discrimination relies upon the ability to compute multiple useful target features based upon known target characteristics.  To improve the discrimination results, the temptation is to calculate ever more specificfeatures that rely heavily on a priori target knowledge.  In this project, CSC proposes an evaluation of a more general, complete set of features derived directly from the outputs of a large wavelet filter bank.   In previous work, CSC has developed ananalog, massively parallel, real-time video processing system capable of bulk spatio-temporal filtering. The enabling device uses analog silicon retinas in multi-chip architectures for complex, agile, spatial-frequency filtering enabling the implementationof a wavelet-based filter bank.  A good wavelet basis forms a filter bank that is a compromise between a completely specific, matched filter bank and a generic basis.  In Phase I, methods for finding bases optimal for discrimination will be investigated.In Phase II, CSC will implement the most promising algorithms in hard-ware for hardware-in-the-loop testing.  The spatio-temporal motion energy system previously developed by CSC has the potential to provide sophisticated wavelet discrimination of subtletarget characteristics both spatially and temporally with an extremely large computational capability.  Target analysis capabilities using non-linear motion energy image processing techniques integrated in analog VLSI image proces-sors are ideally suitedfor compact, low power, military applications ranging from remote sens-ing platforms to micro-unmanned aerial vehicles. The spatio-temporal motion flow processor being developed is enabling to Missile Defense Agency (MDA) program algorithms that flow downto major missile defense systems.

Standard first aid for exposure to many chemical warfare agents and toxins includes the immediate administration of relevant antidotes using an autoinjector.  When an attack occurs, prefilled autoinjectors must be immediately available and thus highly portable, and they must be suitable for use by nonmedical personnel.  Similarly, rapid distribution and administration of targeted vaccines is critical during a biological outbreak.  Storage of drug formulations as separate components within the injector (e.g., a dry medication and a diluent) can significantly extend the shelf life of many medications.  Creare proposes to develop a novel miniaturized autoinjector that automatically mixes two or more pre-filled components immediately prior to injection.  The drug storage and reconstitution method is based on Creare&quot;s recently patented technology for disposable, pre-filled drug cartridges and is applicable to single-component, dry/wet, liquid/liquid, and multicomponent combinations.

This challenge has been met during Phase I of this program.  The focus of Phase II is onmaking the system more compact, and on increasing the output energy.Multi-wavelength lasing, although not always efficient with some laser systems because of phase-matching requirements that depend on the emitted wavelength, is generally accomplished by second and/or third harmonic generation of the fundamental emission.For wavelengths that are longer than the fundamental, Raman conversion or Optical Parametric Oscillation is the process that is usually chosen.  Both of these optical processes are non-linear in nature, and therefore require high peak powers.  These powerlevels are typically achieved with a short pulse laser system using either Q-switching, and/or mode-locking.  Achieving high output energies, with long pulses that can vary from hundreds of nanoseconds to several milliseconds, is however a more difficulttask.  At the completion of Phase I, we have demonstrated just that, leveraging on various proprietary technologies developed by Light Age, Inc.Light Age uses alexandrite crystals as the laser gain medium.  These lasers are all solid state, quasi-four level vibronic sources, and therefore tunable.  Light Age leverages the unique optical properties of alexandrite and its proprietary pulsestretching technology to produce laser output with pulse durations of 500 to 5000 ns.  In order to reach peak powers needed for nonlinear conversion, the laser output is amplified in a chain of alexandrite amplifier stages.  The combination ofalexandrite's high damage threshold and excellent capacity to store energy (far exceeding other solid state materials) makes alexandrite very well suited for producing extremely high output energies.  After the amplification of the pulse-stretchedalexandrite laser, a high peak power beam is generated that is suitable for nonlinear frequency conversion.  The alexandrite laser combined with Light Age's high efficiency Raman conversion techniques allows for tunable laser radiation throughout thevisible and near IR.  Multispectral output is achieved using the combination of these technologies with harmonic generation. The development of a multispectral line long pulse laser source greatly enhances Light Age's laser technology and allows us to increase our position in a few markets and enter into many new markets. Many of these applications will benefit from one or moreof the otherwise hard to achieve laser specifications.  The markets we expect to address with this technology are: 1) The production of holograms using a three color coherent output of the laser source.  Holograms created using pulse laser sources reducemuch of the complexity of stabilizing the object since the hologram can be produced with a single laser pulse in the hundreds of nanosecond durations. 2) Medical diagnostic is utilizing lasers in order to detect early stage cancers and other abnormalitiesthroughout the body.  These lasers can be used to excite fluorescent contrast agents or be used in photoacoustic imaging.  The wavelength range in the fundamental of alexandrite's tuning curve is ideal for deep penetration into tissue making it an idealsource for medical diagnostics. 3) Selective laser trabeculloplasty for the treatment of glucoma. Laser pulses of  1-10 ms  may have an advantage in preserving the integrity of the trabecular meshwork.Due to the versatility of the pulse stretched, high energy alexandrite laser, we expect that many applications will be developed or enhanced by this laser source.  These developments will allow some of early stage research applications to mature intolarger commercial markets.",Rick Frost,VP of Sales and Marketing,(732) 563-0600,RFrost@light-age.com,Bruce Boczar,Senior Scientist,(732) 563-0600,bboczar@light-age.com,,,,"['design', 'laser system', 'simultaneous', 'high output', 'phase program', 'focus phase', 'output energy', 'multi-wavelength lasing', 'laser system', 'harmonic generation', 'emission', 'raman conversion optical Parametric Oscillation process', 'optical process', 'peak power', 'short pulse laser system', 'q-switching', 'mode-locking', 'completion phase', 'Light Age', 'crystal laser', 'gain medium', 'laser solid state', 'source', 'Light', 'optical property', 'technology', 'laser output', 'nonlinear conversion', 'laser output', 'chain alexandrite amplifier stage', 'damage', 'threshold', 'solid state material', 'output energy', 'pulse-stretchedalexandrite laser', 'nonlinear frequency', 'conversion', 'Light', 'laser radiation thevisible', 'combination technology harmonic generation', 'development', 'multispectral line', 'Light Age laser', 'market', 'market', 'laser specification', 'market', 'technology', 'production', 'color', 'coherent output', 'pulse laser source', 'object hologram', 'single laser pulse nanosecond duration', 'detect', 'abnormalitiesthroughout body', 'laser use excite', 'fluorescent contrast agent', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'tuning curve', 'deep penetration', 'tissue', 'treatment', 'laser pulse   1', 'integrity', 'high energy alexandrite laser', 'laser source', 'development']"

In previous work, large volumetric fractions of Au, Ag, Cu and Al nanoparticles (NPs) were incorporated into a porous aramid nanofiber (ANF) matrix to realize films that have high electrical conductivity, yet maintain superior mechanical strength, the properties, which are usually hard to achieve simultaneously. Furthermore, the composite films demonstrate excellent flexibility, which is superior to other related classes of reported flexible conductors including carbon based nanomaterials (CNTs and graphene) and other metallic nanomaterials. The unique network structure enables high electrical conductivity and robust mechanical behavior of the metal-ANF films. Most pertinently for mass-restrictive applications, we demonstrated that copper-ANF composites had ~90 % less mass density than solid copper, but with electrical properties (conductivity, ampacity) that were at least 33 % of the bulk value. During Phase I, we will first find the lower limits of achievable mass that still provides acceptable conductivity, ampacity, and strength in both cylindrical and polygonal cross-sectional wires. We will then characterize the conductive and insulating properties of self-insulated wires, in which a single fabrication process can produce non-uniform conductivity with eleven orders of magnitude difference in the measured resistivity in different regions of the solid.

A Dry Heat system is developed to permit very rapid thawing (under 10 minutes) instead of the 40 to 60minutes now necessary using an inconvenient, large water bath.  This heating system is also used to warm IV fluids in surgery. Rapid thawing is crucial to meeting the military needs for thawed deglycerolized blood in emergencies.  A new blood bag with itsprotective shipping container is developed that will have less than 3% breakage, compared to current 20% to 50% breakage in military use. The current deglycerolization process is modified to decrease the duration of the process (to under 20 minutes) and toreduce processing fluid quantities.The proposed research will evaluate the feasibility of these various approaches by fabricating and testing hardware and disposables and modifying current red cell washing processes.  Military frozen blood users and bloodexperts will aid in this evaluation.These improvements to the military frozen blood system will decrease substantially (at least a factor of 2) the time needed to make red cells available in emergencies.

This is partially achieved by introducing and constantly improving enabling technologies. One such technology is structure based drug design. Determining the structure of a small molecule (drug candidate or lead compound) to a biological receptor (protein implicated in disease) is a necessary step in this methodology. The dominant experimental approach used to achieve this goal is X- ray crystallography, while nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) plays a lesser role in spite of large investments both in academia and industry. NMR is hampered by the size of protein that can be studied and the need to go through a lengthy structure determination process. However, NMR could play a greater role if it was possible to reduce the time effort necessary to solve the structure of a protein-ligand complex. Moreover, in cases where it is not possible to obtain a crystal NMR can play a significant role. Through the use of solid-state NMR studies membrane proteins or proteins with solubility problems can be studied or in cases where only homology models of a protein are available NMR could play a role through the validation of active site structure hypotheses generated in homology modeling studies. The aim of the proposed research is to extend and commercialize QuantumBio?s successful linear-scaling semiempirical quantum mechanical NMR approach (NMRScore) to chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analysis. In Phase I of this proposal the limits of applicability will be explored. In the Phase II proposal extension of the methodology via reparameterization of H, C O and N 1 13 17 15 NMR will be carried out. Furthermore, the streamlining of the workflow will be researched and implemented. Finally, this proposal is aiming to fully productize and commercialize this breakthrough technology. It is anticipated that by making this application commercially available the use of NMR in structure-based design efforts will be enhanced and the NMR tool and service market size can be further expanded. Significantly, the tool-box of structure based drug design will gain an important new method which will enable drug development for targets inaccessible to today?s mainstream drug discovery paradigm. Thus, in the near future important underserved diseases can be targeted more efficiently. The successful completion of the Fast-Track STTR grant will have a major impact on improving human health. It will improve the quality of protein structures, facilitate the understanding of biomolecular dynamics and will provide higher quality structural insights into protein/ligand (drug) interactions which will enhance our ability to rationally design novel therapeutics for human diseases.",LANCE WESTERHOFF,,(814) 235-6908,LANCE@QUANTUMBIOINC.COM,KENNETH MERZ,,(352) 392-6973,merz@qtp.ufl.edu,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'health', 'development', 'drug fast', 'mission', 'technology', 'technology structure', 'drug design', 'structure small molecule', 'drug candidate lead compound', 'biological receptor', 'disease', 'experimental approach', 'goal', 'nuclear magnetic resonance (', 'investment', 'industry', 'structure', 'crystal nmr', 'solid-state nmr study membrane protein protein', 'validation', 'active site', 'hypothesis', 'homology modeling', 'linear-scaling semiempirical quantum mechanical nmr approach', 'chemical shift perturbation', 'phase proposal limit', 'phase', 'proposal extension methodology reparameterization', 'proposal', 'technology', 'nmr structure-based design', 'nmr tool', 'service', 'market', 'size', 'tool-box structure base drug design', 'method', 'drug development', 'target', 'disease', 'target', 'impact', 'health', 'quality', 'protein structure', 'biomolecular dynamic', 'quality', 'drug', 'interaction']"

As most of the interest lies closer to the surface, below mid-level cloud cover the ability to more closely approach the surface increases the data fidelity and quality captured by the sensors. MARVEL accomplishes the goal of all Venus exploration by combining advanced material configurations with innovative thermal control configurations for the payload. This results in a specialty Venus Aerobot system that can reach and remain at a lower altitude for longer times in the atmosphere of Venus to capture more and higher quality data on Venus.The current state of the art (SOA) in Venus aerial vehicles has been designed to operate within the altitude range of 50 to 60 km. This innovation will 1 extend the operating range over 40 to 60 km, and integrate into a supporting aerial platform that will be able to operate on the sunlit side of Venus and be able to transit the night side and survive several circumnavigations around the planet.",Shannon Espinoza,,(520) 382-1726,Sespinoza@paragonsdc.com,Danny Milobar,,(520) 382-4487,dmilobar@paragonsdc.com,,,,"['goal', 'surface', 'interior structure', 'aerial vehicle', 'design', 'Paragon thin Red line Aerospace', 'scientific payload', 'mechanical-compression', 'exercise', 'Venus', 'Venus', 'surface', 'issue', 'environmental', 'surface', 'Venus', 'gaseous component favorable material', 'sensor', 'thermal environment', 'surface', 'mid-level', 'cloud cover', 'surface', 'sensor', 'goal', 'Venus', 'advanced material', 'thermal control', 'payload', 'Venus Aerobot system', 'low altitude', 'long time', 'Venus', 'Venus', 'SOA', 'Venus aerial vehicle', 'operate']"

One means of meeting this challenge is the replacement of liquid transportation fuels based on petroleum with cellulosic bioethanol.  However, cellulosic ethanol remains too costly to be commercially feasible, in part due to the generation of organic acids that inhibit ethanol fermentation.  This project will couple cellulolytic, ethanologenic, and electricity generating (electricigenic) bacteria in a process that eliminates these inhibitory organic acids, enhances ethanol production, and generates electricity. The cellulolytic and ethanologenic bacteria will hydrolyze the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of lignocellulose, and produce ethanol and inhibitory organic acids.  The acids produced by the fermentative bacteria, and during the pretreatment of the biomass (e.g. corn stover), will then be consumed by the electricigenic bacteria in a microbial fuel cell component of an ethanologenic/electricigenic bioreactor.  Phase I will determine the feasibility of using this combined microbial process.  Phase II will involve improvement and scale-up of the process.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   A procedure that produces bioethanol and biopower less expensively and more efficiently should prove to be highly marketable.

The proposed SiGe BiCMOS technology enables integration and performance well beyond current T/R components, allowing the XRB to be moved into the T/R element for RF-to-bits capability. The XRB’s baseline architecture was defined during Phase I, and key parameters specified. Key circuits were preliminarily designed and simulated to assess and project the ADC’s performance.

Agents are defined as either human, computational, or hardware that can act on information.  Information that can flow to an agent is filtered based on priority.  This protects human agents from information glut and information overload and reduces bandwidth requirements on communications channels.  Agents react to the presented information by accepting it, discounting it, or querying the system for more information.  All decisions and actions are recorded and modeled by the system in order to verify correct and efficient processing of information.  The proposed system will operate independently of flight deck systems but will have access to required information sources.  It will not impose an additional monitoring responsibility on the flight crew except for when safety issues surface.  At that point, the flight crew's attention is captured and then predefined, prioritized information is presented in a selected format.  The proposed system consists of the major software components: the Metadata Workbench, the Condition Monitor, and the Notification Terminal.  The Metadata Workbench is used to identify all agents, roles, conditions of interest which trigger information flows, and information with associated context and priority.  The notification mechanism, the information flow's destination, and the format for reporting information along with justification is also defined by the workbench.

Columbia St., Ste 300",,CHAPEL HILL,NC,-,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary target for opioid analgesics. While opioids are the most frequently used and effective analgesics for the treatment of moderate to severe clinical pain, their prolonged use leads to reduced efficacy and a number of adverse side effects, including post dosing-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. MOR induces analgesia through several mechanisms including the inhibition of second messenger pathways and modulation of ion channel activity. Nevertheless, the opposite, opioid induced cellular excitation, has also been demonstrated and proposed to mediate reductions in efficacy, tolerance, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia following the exposure to opioids. While an array of mechanisms has been advanced that contribute to these use-dependence changes in MOR-mediated effects, we have recently identified a novel mechanism underlying the shift in MOR signaling: a MOR splice variant encoding a functional 6 transmembrane (6TM) receptor. This 6TM isoform was identified in a study designed to determine the genetic basis for variability in sensitivity to exogenous opiates. Importantly, morphine exposure to cells overexpressing the 6TM receptor isoform leads to excitatory cellular effects rather than the classic inhibitory effects that are produced by stimulating the canonical 7TM MOR isoform. The discovery of this new alternative 6TM isoform, which evokes responses that oppose the biological effects of the major 7TM isoform, provides a unique opportunity to identify pharmacological probes that will further our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate the pharmacodynamic effects of opioids and will enable the future development of new opioid compounds that show 7TM agonist and/or 6TM antagonist properties providing high analgesic efficacy with a diminished ability to produce post dosing-induced hyperalgesia, analgesic tolerance, and unwanted physiological side effects. To take maximal advantage of this opportunity, an interdisciplinary investigative team with unique, but complementary, areas of expertise has been assembled to develop, validate and characterize the in silico models of the major 7TM and alternative 6TM receptor isoforms can be used to identity putative isoform selective compounds. The long-term goal of this effort is to develop novel opioids that evoke high potency analgesia without deleterious short- or long-term consequences.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While opioids are the most frequently used and effective analgesicsfor the treatment of moderate to severe clinical pain, their prolonged use leads to a number of treatment limiting side-effects in a large percentage of patients. An experienced multidisciplinary investigative team proposes a set of studies that have derived from new data on the molecular and signaling basis of opioid receptor pharmacology and associated side-effects. These studies will build in silico models of the human 5-opioid receptor isoforms whose activities differentially contribute to the clinicalefficacy of opioids and allow identification of novel and potentially a new class of opioid compounds that will show high analgesic properties with a diminished ability to produce opioid-induced hyperalgesia, analgesic tolerance, and unwanted physiologicalside effects.",JACKIE INSCOE,,(919) 261-7886,jinscoe@algynomics.com,LUDA DIATCHENKO,,(919) 843-2549,ldiatchenko@algynomics.com,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'analgesic treatment', 'adverse effect', 'post', 'mechanism', 'cellular excitation', 'reduction', 'exposure', 'array mechanism', 'use-dependence change', 'mor-mediated effect', 'mechanism', 'mor splice variant', 'encode', 'study design', 'genetic basis', 'sensitivity', 'exposure', 'inhibitory effect', 'response', 'biological effect', 'mechanism', 'pharmacodynamic effect', 'development', 'opioid compound', 'property', 'post dosing-induced hyperalgesia', 'physiological effect', 'area expertise assemble', 'model', 'selective compound', 'long-term', 'goal', 'long-term', 'consequence', 'public', 'health', 'treatment', 'lead number', 'treatment', 'side-effect', 'study', 'molecular signaling', 'side-effect', 'study', 'model', 'receptor isoform activity', 'identification', 'opioid compound', 'analgesic property', 'effect']"

TechnologyInternational, Inc. (TII) recently developed novel microwave and combustion synthesis methods for brazing polycrystalline diamond and tungsten carbide for commercial abrasive applications. These brazing techniques were developed by TII, Colorado School ofMines (CSM), and NASA JPL, with financial support from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the Gas Technology Institute (GTI). The joining of dissimilar material pairs for lightweight armorusage, with coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) ratios similar to that of diamond and tungsten carbide, can be applied with confidence using similar scientific methods and brazing techniques.  TII has demonstrated the ability to control residual thermalstress while achieving attachment shear strength in excess of 345 MPa (50,000 psi). TII respectfully submits a proposal for a six-month Phase I and four-month Phase I Option project as follows:Task 1  - Materials and ProcessingTask 2  - Microwave BrazingTask 3  - Visual, Ultrasonic, Impact and Shear TestingTask 4  - Reports and Presentations      1.2.  Anticipated Benefits and Potential Commercial ApplicationsHigh-strength bonding of dissimilar materials, particularly with high-performance ceramics to low and high-density metals, has commercial appeal and application in many industries. Obviously, the primary purpose of this proposal is to increase protectionof U.S. Army military hardware and personnel. Broader applications are numerous, including power turbines, heat exchangers, nozzles, commercial aircraft, automobiles, mining, and earth moving equipment, metal refining, oil refining, chemical processingfacilities, petroleum drilling and production, medical devices, and abrasives. Some of these private sector applications will require higher temperature metal substrates, such as steel, molybdenum and tungsten carbide, a modest extension of the scope ofthis proposal.Once technically successful, the economics for the market place must be addressed. For military hardware, superior ballistic performance is paramount.  The tactical importance of superior lightweight armor is under the national security umbrella andoutweighs industrial commercial considerations.  For military purposes, field fabrication and servicing units are well within expectations.   Nevertheless, the proposed development of equipment and processes to join dissimilar materials for lightweightarmor, does not entail huge capital investment or unwieldy production components. Power requirements for this technology are less than 5 KW and the system can be designed to become modular for deployment.For private-sector applications, new product cycles and scalability are consistent with the natural flow of microwave brazing process development. Interest in licensing the process and equipment for diamond- abrasive applications has already beenexpressed.  The initial size of the commercial market for an advanced method for dissimilar brazing would be 50 - 100 millions of dollars. Capital investment would be substantial in meeting what is perceived as accelerating double-digit demand and wouldmost likely be accomplished employing some or all of the following: cash flow from operations, interim financing, venture capital, partnerships, and licensing arrangements.  Peripheral growth in the manufacture and servicing of processing equipment wouldfollow. Furthermore, no hazardous by-products are created, exploitation of resources is low, and other environmental impacts are negligible or non-existent.Because of TII's prior work and experience in this area, the likelihood for new discovery during a Phase I project is high and success likely.

There are two ways to model ship magnetic signatures; through the use of finite element based analytical models and through the use of physical scale models (PSM). Finite element based analytical models are less expensive and have a much faster realization time. However, the analytical models do not accurately portray the magnetic field leading to either under designed or over designed magnetic signal suppression systems. Physical scale modeling processes have been refined to the point that the models can generate a magnetic signal that is within 10% of the signal of the full sized ship. The physical scale models are very expensive; they are handcrafted. The realization time for the physical scale model takes too long resulting in PSM obsolescence before completion. A means to use a low cost manufacturing process and high magnetic permeability materials holds the promise of reducing the cost and realization time for high fidelity PSM.

This SBIR  application focuses on predictive modeling of febrile and severe neutropenia and anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer (ESBC). Oncologists routinely make chemotherapy decisions without access to risk-related evidence or t o modeling tools that can qualify risk for the individual patient. In this SBIR, Proventys will implement: (1) a risk modeling system that flexibly incorporates new models and that can be used to locally validate data and biomarkers, and (2)  Chemotherapy  Solutions,  a physician-targeted software interface providing evidence-based decision support that is convenient, has robust predictive power, and is both flexible and cost-effective for institutions ranging from large HMOs and medical centers to small onc ology practices. The novel modeling technology will generalize to prediction of risk associated with numerous cancer therapeutics, and will readily integrate with existing electronic medical records (EMRs). Phase I specific aims are: (1) To incorporate pre dictive models for ESBC/chemotherapy risk and outcomes into Proventys' Model Library. (2) To validate the system's accuracy in predicting adverse chemotherapy outcomes in ESBC patients; we will conduct this test in an out-of-sample dataset of Duke cancer p atients. (3) To create a clinical analysis framework for recommend-ing optimal therapeutic choices, based on five-year survival probability and risks of febrile/severe neutropenia and anemia. (4) To build Chemotherapy Solutions upon this framework. (5) To  assess (a) providers' satisfaction with Chemotherapy Solutions, via physician focus groups, and (b) the effect of this tool on prescribing choices, using a simulated trial with mock patient data and an expert clinical panel. At the end of Phase I, Proventy s will have: enhanced its Predictive Modeler and Model Library with additional well-studied, validated, predictive models; created a clinical analysis framework that predicts specific risks associated with chemotherapy for the targeted diseases; and built  and assessed a physician-targeted decision support software tool. In Phase II, focused on cultivating commercial potential of Chemotherapy Solutions, we will: further develop predictive models, conduct a larger prospective trial, integrate the tool with st andard EMRs, build user-friendly data input modules, and incorporate a cost-effectiveness selection feature, among other enhancements. We will continue to cultivate relationships (already initiated) with major HMOs, insurance corporations, and medical cent ers during Phase II, in preparation for full commercialization of Chemotherapy Solutions and the broader Proventys family of Clinical Solutions in Phase III.This Phase I SBIR project, proposed by Proventys, Inc., will lead to the implementation of a clinic al decision support tool that assist oncologists in improving health outcomes for cancer patients preparing to undergo chemotherapy. This cost-effective, web-based tool will be suitable for broad utilization in oncology provider organizations ranging from  small group practices to large academic medical centers and HMOs. The SBIR effort will also result in powerful enhancement of the Proventys Model Library and Risk Assessment System, which will open new avenues of medical research to further improve care of  cancer patients.", ,,(919) 321-2384,ralph.snyderman@proventys.com, ,,() -,,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'evidence-based decision', 'application', 'modeling febrile', 'breast cancer', 'decision access', 'risk-related', 'modeling tool', 'individual', 'risk modeling', 'model', 'datum', 'physician-targeted software', 'evidence-based decision support', 'predictive power', 'cost-effective', 'modeling technology', 'prediction risk', 'cancer', 'electronic medical record', 'dictive model', 'risk outcome', ""Proventys ' Model"", 'system', 'accuracy', 'outcome', 'conduct test out-of-sample dataset Duke cancer', 'clinical analysis', ""provider '"", 'satisfaction', 'physician', 'effect tool', 'clinical panel', 'end phase', 'Predictive modeler Model', 'Library', 'validate', 'predictive model', 'clinical analysis', 'chemotherapy target disease', 'physician-targeted decision support software tool', 'phase', 'predictive model', 'cost-effectiveness', 'enhancement', 'relationship', 'preparation commercialization', 'Clinical Solutions phase', 'decision support tool', 'health outcome cancer', 'cost-effective', 'web-based tool', 'enhancement', 'Proventys Model', 'Library risk assessment system', 'care   cancer']"

OC is mostly diagnosed at an advanced stage. Patients undergo debulking surgery and chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery. Conventional drugs are carboplatin and paclitaxel. Despite the recent introduction of FDA-approved PARP- and VEGF-inhibitors for OC, the vast majority of patients will experience disease recurrence that requires additional treatment and recurrent OC is essentially incurable. New therapeutics to improve patient outcomes are needed. Transcriptional profiles have demonstrated that the master transcriptional regulator STAT3 to be highly active in OC, determined by increased phosphorylation in SH2-dimerization domain (pSTAT3-Y705) and induction of oncogenic factors. Active STAT3 in metastatic and chemoresistant OC correlates with poor patient survival, and inhibiting STAT3 with shRNA, or small molecules inhibited OC progression, supporting the objective of targeting STAT3 as a viable therapeutic strategy. Additionally, we demonstrate significant upregulation of STAT3 activity in OC cells is strongly associated with increased platinum resistance. We hypothesize that targeting STAT3 will block multiple oncogenic pathways and sensitize OC cells to chemotherapy. Although transcriptions factors (TF) like STAT3 are attractive therapeutic targets, TFs are challenging to target with small molecules due to lack of clear small molecule binding pockets, large surface areas important for protein-protein interactions and large intrinsically disordered domains. At Altay Therapeutics, we developed a platform that enables identification of small molecule binding pockets within intrinsically disordered domains in previously undruggable TFs, allowing a novel approach for specific targeting of STAT3 and development of potent STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i). Using our platform, we identified inhibitors that reduced STAT3 DNA binding by targeting the disordered DNA binding domain. Importantly, these STAT3i have minimal STAT1 inhibitory activity, low cytotoxicity and when used in combination with CDDP, synergized and increased platinum sensitivity across OC cell lines. We propose three aims based on quantitative metrics that will clearly define the top candidate(s) which inhibit STAT3 compared to existing STAT3is and block OC progression. In Aim 1, we will determine STAT3 target gene inhibition and measure effects on secreted inflammatory factors with Altay’s novel STAT3is. In Aim 2, we will carry out in vitro phenotypic studies with human and transgenic mouse OC cells using STAT3is in combination with platinum chemotherapy. In Aim 3, we will determine antitumor activity of STAT3i using OC cells in orthotopic and intraperitoneal in vivo models alone and in combination with platinum chemotherapy. The proposed studies will establish the potential for targeting STAT3 in treating chemoresistant OC and guide new therapeutic strategies in this setting. We will then pursue an SBIR phase 2 grant that will include medicinal chemistry efforts and additional animal studies and ultimately commercialization of a first-in-class STAT3 inhibitor for OC.",ALI OZES,,(650) 455-1147,ali@altaytherapeutics.com,ALI OZES,,(650) 455-1147,ali@altaytherapeutics.com,,,,"['Abstract/Summary', 'epithelial ovarian cancer', 'death', 'debulking surgery', 'debulking surgery', 'drug carboplatin', 'disease recurrence', 'treatment', 'patient outcome', 'transcriptional profile', 'master transcriptional regulator', 'active', 'phosphorylation sh2-dimerization domain', 'induction', 'oncogenic factor', 'target', 'oc cell', 'platinum resistance', 'target', 'block', 'oc cell chemotherapy', 'transcription factor', 'target', 'target', 'surface area', 'identification', 'intrinsically disorder', 'development', 'dna binding domain', 'low', 'platinum sensitivity', 'oc cell line', 'metric', 'target', 'inflammatory factor Altay', 'carry vitro', 'antitumor activity', 'oc cell orthotopic', 'study', 'potential', 'target', 'SBIR phase 2 grant', 'animal study', 'commercialization']"

One of the more recent goals of cochlear implant (CI) surgery is the preservation of residual hearing to improve overall patient outcomes. Unfortunately, up to 50% of patients experience delayed residual hearing loss following cochlear implant surgery, resulting in a diminished quality of life. To address this issue, iotaMotion is developing an insertion system to assist surgeons in performing controlled and consistent CI electrode insertions as well as to monitor the electrocochleography (ECochG) readings taken from the cochlea during CI electrode insertion, which have been shown to indicate cellular damage and residual hearing loss. The system controls the rate of electrode array insertion and responds in real time to ECochG feedback received from the cochlear tissues via a feedback loop. In Phase I, a working benchtop prototype was developed and the system response to ECochG signals was demonstrated in both benchtop and large animal in vivo proof-of-concept studies. Control algorithms were also developed as part of the feedback loop to the insertion system’s motor unit. Continuing with these results, the goals of this proposed Phase II SBIR project are to: 1) Improve System Usability and Enhance Use Features. With the goal of continuing to improve the prototype developed in Phase I, Aim 1 work will improve system fidelity, incorporate real-time impedance checks, integrate the system into an easy-to-use tablet for use in the OR, and evaluate usability. 2) Establish Manufacturing and Quality Controls. The supply chain and manufacturing and quality procedures to verify/validate system safety and reliability will be implemented using relevant standards and FDA guidance to define testing procedures. The electrical safety, sterility, biocompatibility, functionality, and data security testing of production-level devices that will be used for pre-clinical studies and commercialization will be performed. 3) Evaluate In Vivo Efficacy of the Combined System. The system will be evaluated in an acute in vivo model of cochlear implantation. By comparing usage of the system to the current gold standard of manual CI electrode insertions, iotaMotion will evaluate the system’s ability to monitor ECochG signals from the cochlea and will confirm that the system induces no increases in scalar translocations or OSL fractures when compared to manual insertions as assessed by 3D X-ray microscopy. 4) Perform Observational Clinical Study. As part of the regulatory strategy, the ability of the ECochG monitoring system to collect reliable and significant ECochG signals in an observational clinical study will be evaluated. Completion of these Phase II Aims will set the stage for the development and production of the system in a GMP environment and execution of a prospective clinical trial designed to establish safety and efficacy in humans. We envision the data collected to comprise the basis for the Device History Record that will be used to prepare for first-in-man studies. This Phase II funding will help secure additional company investment and will move us much closer to commercializing this much-needed treatment for people suffering from disabling hearing loss.Project Narrative Despite the many advances in cochlear implant technology, recent clinical trials have found that up to 50% of patients who undergo “hearing preservation” cochlear implant surgery can experience continued hearing decline after surgery—likely due to intracochlear trauma experienced during electrode insertion. To address this issue, iotaMotion has developed an insertion tool that couples cochlear implant ECochG measurements to a micromechanical control system to aid the surgeon in sensing, predicting, and mitigating insertion trauma during an electrode insertion. This SBIR Phase II project will allow major further advances to be made with this novel tool that, when commercialized, will significantly reduce the incidence of residual hearing loss for the millions who are candidates for receiving cochlear implants.",CHRISTOPHER KAUFMANN,,(512) 402-3026,iotamotion@gmail.com,ALLAN HENSLEE,,(512) 402-3026,allan@iotamotion.com,,,,"['summary/abstract', 'cochlear implant', 'surgery preservation', 'patient outcome', 'cochlear implant surgery', 'quality', 'issue', 'insertion system', 'cellular damage residual hearing loss', 'system control', 'real time', 'cochlear tissue feedback', 'phase', 'prototype', 'system response', 'ecochg signal', 'proof-of-concept study', 'control algorithm', 'loop', 'goal', 'phase', 'system', 'goal', 'prototype', 'phase', 'system fidelity', 'real-time impedance check', 'Manufacturing quality control', 'safety', 'testing procedure', 'electrical safety', 'datum security testing', 'production-level device', 'pre-clinical study', 'commercialization', 'combined system', 'system', 'acute vivo model', 'cochlear implantation', 'gold standard', 'iotamotion evaluate system ability', 'ecochg signal', 'system', 'manual', '3d x-ray microscopy', 'observational clinical study', 'monitoring system', 'ecochg signal', 'stage development', 'production system', 'gmp environment', 'safety', 'Device history Record', 'first-in-man study', 'phase', 'treatment people', 'hearing loss', 'cochlear implant technology', 'clinical trial', 'cochlear implant surgery', 'surgery', 'issue', 'insertion tool', 'surgeon sensing', 'tool', 'residual hearing loss', 'cochlear implant']"

The analyst is presented with an incomplete data space from which to produce an intelligence picture. DAC proposes a system called Resolving Independent Perspectives by Providing Learning Enabled Enhance Fusion For Elastic Cloud Technologies (RIPPLE-EFFECT). RIPPLE-EFFECT provides a framework to fuse semantic enhancements from multiple vendors through the use of machine learning algorithms which infer correlations between both the semantic structure and the extracted semantic content. RIPPLE-EFFECT supports scalable cross-document inference over the semantically enhanced data space with dynamically evolving search patterns based on data encountered during the search and the semantic meaning behind the initial query. RIPPLE-EFFECT maintains a consistent data space and intelligence picture across geographically separated systems specialized to the area of interest and time period of interest for each system through lock-free continuous synchronization.",Dana Ho,Contracts Manager,(703) 414-5016,dana.ho@dac.us,Mark Frymire,Chief Technology Officer,(703) 414-5139,mark.frymire@dac.us,,,,"['situational awareness', 'fuse', 'information', 'document', 'data source', 'biometric', 'fuse', 'information', 'datum', 'system', 'low-bandwidth connection', 'datum space', 'intelligence picture', 'dac', 'Independent', 'Learning Enabled', 'Enhance', 'ripple-effect', 'ripple-effect', 'semantic enhancement', 'correlation', 'semantic structure extract', 'semantic content', 'ripple-effect', 'cross-document inference', 'datum space', 'pattern base datum', 'semantic', 'query', 'ripple-effect', 'intelligence', 'system', 'time period']"

A critical challenge in the commercialization of SOFCs is to develop a low cost solution to the problem of chromium contamination of the cathode from the chromium Cr) containing stainless steel components within the balance of plant BOP) components such as air feed and heat exchanger system. The solution must be capable of withstanding an operating environment of 900oC and be stable in the presence of atmospheric humidity while preventing emission of chromium vapors from Cr-containing steel components. In this project, HiFunda will develop and demonstrate an innovative plasma spray process for applying low cost durable ceramic coatings to low cost steel parts used in SOFC BOP components to enhance their performance in operating conditions, and reduce the lifetime cost of these components. In the Phase I project, compositions that have adequate thermal expansion compatibility with typical stainless steels used in SOFC BOP components will be developed. Processing parameters that can produce dense, thin ceramic coatings of these down-selected compositions will be identified and applied on low cost stainless steel substrates, and the chromium vaporization at elevated temperatures will be measured. Finally, cost models will be developed for a variety of production scale levels to assess the cost savings potential of the proposed coating system.. The coatings developed through this project can be used to significantly enhance the reliability of stainless steel components used in SOFC BOP components, and ultimately enable greater adoption of SOFC technology for utility scale power generation. In particular, the new technology is expected to reduce degradation rates of SOFC systems and can help to meet DOE target requirements of 40,000 hours of service for stationary fuel cell applications and greater than 5,000 hours for transportation systems fuel cell vehicles), while meeting cost targets of $400/kW. SOFCs, especially in CHP applications, can have very high combined thermal and electrical efficiencies over 80%).

A common medium of collection is satellite images. However, combing through the captured images for objects of interest (OoI) requires a tremendous investment in analyst-hours. With the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), some geographic information systems (GIS) and mapping techniques have transitioned into fully-automated or semi-automated systems, dramatically decreasing data processing labor and improving the quality of results. Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, also referred to as GeoAI, is the application of AI and ML to GIS. Disruptive advancements in the field of GeoAI are currently being investigated and developed with the promise of expanding the utility of geospatial information. These advancements are being driven by open availability of geospatial data, advancements in ML methodologies, and increased accessibility of high-performance computing. In partnership with NGA, the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation, as described in the first sub-topic found within the 20.3 Mission Focus Areas document published by AFWERX, is seeking the development of GeoAI methodologies with high potential to deploy in operational environments. As such, Bihrle Applied Research, Inc. proposes the Automated Toolset for Object Identification and Mapping (ATOM). ATOM will provide human analysts with interactive maps and reports that distill enormous amounts of satellite imagery into actionable intelligence. To this end, BAR has identified the following problems that ATOM seeks to research and solve: 1) AI/ML object identification in satellite imagery; 2) Geolocation of identified OoI in satellite imagery; 3) Reporting and mapping techniques that aid human analysts in identifying actionable intelligence. ATOM is designed to generate reports and maps of OoI based on collected data. In Phase I, BAR will utilize the xView dataset for algorithm training, validation, and testing as it contains geolocated satellite imagery that is already labeled with categories of various structures and vehicles. These images are used to train the object identification algorithms. This network is then used by ATOM to process new images from existing data collection processes and generate reports and OoI maps that are sent to analysts to review. Upon review, analysts either approve them or send them back to ATOM in a reinforcement learning feedback loop. If ATOM ever misidentifies an OoI or if analysts identify a new OoI, the analysts will indicate as such on the reports and ATOM will use this information and retrain the objective identification network so that it can continually adapt to ever changing missions. Additionally, analysts will be able to identify specific OoI to track in time and space to generate specific intelligence in time on those objects.",David Gingras,,(757) 766-2416,dgingras@bihrle.com,Kevin McDonough,,(734) 355-5404,kmcdonough@bihrle.com,,,,"['intelligence analyst', 'information', 'comb capture image object', 'investment', 'implementation', 'artificial intelligence', 'geographic information system', 'datum processing', 'quality', 'artificial intelligence', 'disruptive advancement field', 'information', 'high-performance computing', 'NGA', 'Modeling simulation', 'Mission Focus Areas', 'development', 'potential', 'operational environment', 'atom', 'atom', 'satellite', 'actionable intelligence', 'object', 'geolocation', 'satellite', 'mapping technique', 'actionable intelligence', 'atom design', 'collect datum', 'phase', 'BAR', 'dataset algorithm', 'validation', 'testing', 'geolocate satellite imagery label', 'category structure vehicle', 'image', 'network use atom process', 'image', 'map', 'review', 'ATOM reinforcement learning feedback loop', 'ATOM', 'identification', 'network', 'mission', 'time space', 'specific', 'intelligence time object']"

With diabetes, it is expected that patients measure and monitor their own blood glucose levels, their own medication administration, and their own diet and exercise programs. When patients properly and actively manage their own disease, they will minimize the disease progression. Otherwise, the effects can be tragic in terms of disease progression and health care costs. Mismanaged diabetes will eventually put the patient at risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and peripheral vascular disease. Furthermore, there is often a significant time lag between when a patient collects self-care information and when a medical staff is made aware of that information. The new device underdevelopment is designed to actually monitor and evaluate how well patients are self-managing their disease, and then provide feedback to the care staff and the patient when irregularities are detected. Initially, the system is intended to help diabetic patients living in an assisted living setting.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has exacerbated challenges related to social isolation and poor mental health in senior living communities. The virtual reality (VR) program, Rendever, provides an innovative and affordable solution to these challenges by enabling older adults in senior living communities to maintain important family relationships, engage fully with life, and reconnect with their past, regardless of physical location, through its advanced communication and network capabilities.

The migration of not only permanent residents, but also agricultural workers to these areas increases exposure to C. immitis spores that lie dormant in the soil, and as the soil is turned, the spores become airborne and are inhaled.  Once in the lungs, the arthroconidia transform into spherules.  An acute respiratory infection occurs between seven days to three weeks after exposure and often resolves rapidly.  However, in a significant number of cases, chronic pulmonary conditions or dissemination to the meninges, bones, and joints can result, leading to acute, life-threatening disease.  Migrant laborers who are exposed to C. immitis are a highly mobile and underrepresented population, and unfortunately, this disease goes largely unacknowledged in the medical community.  A variety of approaches have been used to fight coccidioidomycosis, including soil treatments, but only a vaccine can completely eliminate this ""emerging disease.""      Currently, there are a number of C. immitis vaccine efforts that use a variety of approaches including selected recombinantly-expressed antigens.  Our long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective vaccine against C. immitis.  In this SBIR Phase I proposal, we will collaborate with Dr. Garry T. Cole, Dr. John Galgiani, Dr. David A. Stevens, and Dr. R. Duke of Globelmmune, Inc., and use Globelmmune's novel, proprietary recombinant yeast delivery system and test heat-killed yeast cells expressing C. immitis proteins as vaccine candidates.  We will accomplish this in two specific aims:      Aim One: Engineer yeast cells to express three C. immitis antigens using recombinant DNA technology.     Aim Two: Test the in vivo efficacy of each vaccine formulation to protect vaccinated animals against a challenge of C. immitis.      This work will be a prelude to work in Phase II that will include detailed testing for in vivo efficacy and safety of each vaccine candidate in several C. immitis infection models.

However, accurate image alignment is a bottleneck due to the poor contrast of individual molecules images. Therefore, in practice, structures of only relatively large macromolecules can be determined by cryo-EM SPR. Phase plates are devices that enhance the signal in cryo-EM images, but current approaches to data collection do not allow us to capitalize on this enhancement. In order to achieve dramatically higher contrast, a much more precise data collection setup is required. The overall objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop enabling technologies for optimal use of the Volta phase plate so its contrast improvement potential can be realized. For practical reasons, this requires ultra-fast analysis of huge image datasets in real-time, necessitating the development of GPU-based algorithms. These methods will enable highly efficient data collection with the high level of precision necessary to use phase plates close-to-focus where the contrast enhancement is the highest. We will develop, implement, and test multiple calibration procedures, with the faster ones performed for each data collection area, while slower, more elaborate ones are performed much less frequently. We will implement full data collection control with real-time data analysis to provide feedback and initial approximation to final results. The redesign of the approach to data collection using a phase plate will benefit all types of cryo-EM SPR and fiber reconstruction: (1) the resolution of many reconstructions will improve significantly, (2) cryo-EM will be applicable to projects where particles have lower mass, and (3) molecular motions for larger particles can be better identified and analyzed.

PH disease progression can be rapid, and any delay in the diagnosis and treatment of PH likely reduces survival. Given its clinical and prognostic significance, early and accurate diagnosis of PH to allow prompt and optimal establishment of clinical care is of critical importance. While traditional maximal/comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has been validated in PH, it has limitations that have hindered its applicability to routine clinical assessment and monitoring. Our preliminary data suggest that the signature ventilatory and pulmonary gas exchange derangements of PH become apparent during even submaximal exercise. Our comprehensive proof-of-concept study (133 patients) supports our hypothesis that the addition of pulmonary gas exchange responses to a standardized 3-minute submaximal exercise test (Shape iCPET) to standard echocardiographic evidence of PH (i.e. RVSP rt50 mmHg, suspicion of RV dysfunction) improves the sensitivity for PH detection by almost 40%. The Shape iCPET system is compact and utilizes pattern-recognition software that automates interpretation, making the system ideally suitable for widespread adoption. The overarching objective of this SBIR proposal is to categorically establish the Shape iCPET as a tool that: 1) improves early detection of PH; and 2) provides an objective evidence-based measure of PH therapy efficacy that can be easily used in academic and community practices. We have established a 10-center consortium of academic and community PH centers for this SBIR proposal. Specific Aim 1 will assess the clinical utility of submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing as a complementary tool for the identification of pulmonary hypertension. Specific Aim 2 will assess whether pharmacotherapy-induced improvements in pulmonary hypertension severity and disease status are reflected in the physiological responses to a standardized submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test.

In spite of this, dental caries continues to be the most prevalent dental disease. It is known that the traditional visual-tactile clinical caries examination procedure cannot detect lesions until they advance to the stage where they are difficult to reverse with fluorides and other measures. The understanding of the caries process has progressed far beyond the point of restricting the evidence for dental caries at the E2 (caries in enamel only) or D3 (caries in enamel and dentin) levels of cavitations. Recording lesions only at the cavitation level is no longer acceptable (ICCCT, 2002). Quantitative Light Fluorescence (QLF) is a technology that has been shown to detect and quantify the progress of lesions at an early stage (pre-cavitation). This technology will allow dental practitioners to: (a) identify early enamel demineralization reflecting caries risk prior to cavitation; (b) implement appropriate interventions to reverse the disease process at an earlier stage with more efficient outcomes; and (c) monitor the success or failure of the applied intervention measures. The overall goal of this program is to develop a QLF research system for use in clinical dental practice. The Phase I program successfully overcame the limitations of a research hand-piece to permit routine clinical use. The Phase 2 program seeks to further refine the instrument hardware and user software to make the technique practical within clinical practice. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) refine the instrument to make it more ergonomic and facilitate practical infection control procedures; (2) verify the ability of the redesigned instrument to detect early caries and monitor changes in a laboratory; (3) develop user-friendly computer software interfaces that are compatible with the existing software for use by dental professionals; (4) develop appropriate training materials; (5) verify efficacy of the system through a clinical investigation. The results of this research should improve dental health of the general population by identifying dental patients at greater risk of developing dental caries and result in the implementation of interventions to reverse the process and reduce or prevent the need for restorations.", ,,(317) 278-7876,,GEORGE STOOKEY,,(317) 278-7876,GSTOOKEY@IUPUI.EDU,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'dental carie', 'fluoride public', 'health program', 'communal water', 'dental practice', 'oral hygiene product', 'dental carie', 'dental disease', 'visual-tactile clinical', 'lesion', 'reverse fluoride measure', 'process', 'dental carie e2', 'level', 'record', 'lesion', 'quantitative light fluorescence', 'lesion early stage', 'technology', 'dental practitioner', 'reverse disease', 'outcome', 'goal program', 'research system', 'phase program', 'clinical use', 'phase 2 program', 'clinical practice', 'application', 'instrument', 'ergonomic', 'redesign instrument', 'detect', 'laboratory', 'computer software', 'dental professional', 'training material', 'dental patient', 'great risk', 'dental carie', 'implementation', 'reverse process']"

In these alloys, oxygen absorption results in a brittle surface layer that has a deteriorating effect on the mechanical properties of the material. Reducing oxygen ingress into these alloys at high temperatures is essential to their cost-effective utilization in both metallic thermal protection systems and hot structure applications.  One promising approach to reduce oxygen ingress (without the application of additional surface coatings) while improving high-temperature mechanical properties is to design or tailor the microstructure in the material surface layer through carefully selected thermo-mechanical surface treatments.  The proposed work will develop and validate a new experimental-modeling framework for capturing the precise effect of the complex material&#039;s internal structure (i.e. microstructure) on oxygen ingress.  In addition, this novel framework will allow compact representation and visualization of microstructure evolution during selected thermo-mechanical processing routes, thereby enabling identification of new promising hybrid processing routes to realize enhanced performance characteristics.  The proposed work is expected to contribute a central building block for the emerging Integrated Computational Materials Science and Engineering (ICMSE) infrastructure.  BENEFIT:  The result of this project will be the first commercially-available Microstructure Informatics Database that objectively links the salient microstructure features, oxygen diffusivity, and thermo-mechanical processing in alpha-beta Ti alloys.  The overall methodology and software tools developed by MRL may also be applied to nearly any other material system with crystalline components, with an economical number of tests and rapid characterization and analysis time.

Phase I analysis suggests that an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption over traditional approaches is achievable for typical UGS scenarios by optimizing services across layers. Our innovation combines novel extensions in link-layer MAC scheduling with recent network layer research in minimum energy diversity routing. The link-layer services also control power state of the radio to reduce errant listening. In all, the combination has been shown to eliminate major sources of energy consumption including idle listening, control signaling, and congestion hot-spots. The approach leverages our preliminary mock-up developed as part of the Phase I simulation testbed and related sensor network research to develop an implementation that addresses pragmatic concerns such as clock-error and computational complexity.

The major barrier slowing the adoption of OLED lighting today is the cost. Costs will come down by economies-of-scale as volumes grow, and OLED materials should become less expensive as OLED display volumes grow.  However, we need innovations to reduce the cost of substrates, encapsulation, and OLED processing.  This project addresses all 3 of these barriers.  With lower costs, the increased application of OLED lighting will help the DOE reach the predicted energy savings possible from SSL. In this project, OLEDWorks will develop a novel substrate and encapsulation process which will reduce the cost of OLED light by: (1) reducing the cost of the substrate by eliminating the need to pattern the anode layer, (2) reduce the OLED deposition capital equipment cost and process operation cost by cutting the number of different masks in half – with the potential to eliminate the masks altogether, and (3) by increasing the lit area of the panel to get significantly more light per panel.  The combination of these three will make the cost of OLED light significantly less, thus reducing the barrier to wider OLED lighting adoption. A key part of the system that will be developed is the application of a relatively new electrical attachment technology to form a hermetic seal around the OLED lighting area.  This system will use a robotically controlled production-scale process that has been installed at OLEDWorks in Rochester. This equipment has been used to develop processes and select materials for electrical attachment; and serendipitously, it appears that application of these methods to form hermetical encapsulation on a simpler substrate while producing a narrower unlit width around the panels is possible. During Phase I, the hermetic sealing will be demonstrated on an increasingly challenging set of formats; from simple systems demonstrating the component parts to the fully integrated OLED system. The final result will be a complete proof-of-principle for this novel substrate and encapsulation system. In Phase II, this technology will be scaled up and commercial products developed and launched that use this technology from our Rochester manufacturing facility. With additional work, we believe that the technology will provide the opportunity to completely eliminate masking in the OLED deposition process which will have the remarkable effects of: (1) further reducing the capital cost of OLED deposition equipment and its operating costs, and (2) enabling simple low-cost Roll-to- Roll or Roll-to-Sheet deposition equipment and processes.  This will enable significant cost-reduction in bendable OLED lighting, which is expected to unleash creativity and create pull from the lighting design community. OLEDWorks is one of the top two OLED lighting panel makers in the world, and the only US producer.

The imaging characteristics will surpass those of current clinical systems by employing an innovative gamma-ray detector system and collimator geometry that is designed specifically for this application. The camera developed here will meet a new and increasing demand for higher resolution, quantitative, and functional micro imaging in the laboratory setting. Applications include imaging of the central nervous system of non-human primates for the purposes of furthering our knowledge about the functional processes at the micro-level, developing diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals, and imaging of other animals for the development of cancer seeking radiopharmaceuticals for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

The existing compressors have proven reliability issues with exhaustive maintenance requirements. A highly reliable compressor with near zero maintenance that can be manufactured readily and operate at high pressure will serve a critical pain point in the AFTAC’s mission to monitor for nuclear explosions banned by several international treaties and moratoria.  Koo and Associates International (KAI), The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (UT-CEM), and Gas Technology Institute (GTI) propose development of a Free Piston Linear Motor Compressor (FPLMC). The FPLMC concept includes a symmetric four stage dual-acting free piston driven by a linear motor. The FPLMC uses multiple stages in which compression in a lower stage on one side feeds the inlet of the next higher stage on the opposite side. This approach uniquely combines the functions of the compressor and motor into one device with a single moving part, thus eliminating inefficiencies inherent in converting rotary motion into linear motion. The design results in fewer parts and wearing components, thus reducing parasitic friction and increasing durability and reliability. The design also promises to ease manufacturing and reduce initial investment, as well as maintenance needs and cost. In Phase I, the project team will develop a FPLMC system that satisfies the performance requires of the Ground-based Nuclear Detonation Research and Development (GNDD R&D) Program and can be a drop-in replacement for existing compressor systems.

The toxic nature of these substances requires careful monitoring over long periods to ensure safety of personnel particularly during mobilization after prolonged storage.  Detecting chemical leaks may also prevent critical system failures within the missiles.  Currently, there are no sensors available that can monitor a range of common propellants with the necessary sensitivity and operating characteristics for military use.  To address this situation, this Phase I SBIR proposal outlines the development of an advanced optical sensing technology for simultaneous detection of hypergolic rocket fuel and oxidizer leaks.  The approach will involve preconcentration of analytes from the rocket canister’s internal atmosphere into a colorimetric polymer film.  Spectroscopic changes will be correlated to propellant leak events.  The Eltron team has 10 years of experience in hypergolic sensor research and development with a significant focus on spectroscopic detection methods.

Studies suggest that certain birth defects, including heart defects, may occur when mothers drink water containing TCE and PCE; the incidence of childhood leukemia appears to be higher; and liver problems and an increased risk of cancer in adults may also be associated with drinking water contaminated with these pollutants. This proposal is driven by the need to develop new technologies to treat TCE and PCE, which contaminate most Superfund sites. We propose using a catalytic converter to destroy these toxic vapors converting them into carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid, which is easily recovered and neutralized. The technology is novel in that a chemically reducing gas such as propane is added to the catalytic converter influent stream, containing PCE and/or TCE vapor in air, in order to protect the catalyst from poisoning, and thereby overcome the major obstacle to widespread commercial implementation. The catalytic converter could be deployed wherever TCE or PCE is currently treated by absorption onto granular activated carbon - the only widely accepted technology. This would be a major advance because the converter would destroy the contaminants on site, rather than transfer them to another medium (activated carbon) for subsequent disposal at a hazardous waste landfill. The system has worked well in the laboratory on a wide variety of chlorinated organics. Here we request funding to fully test the system in the field for prolonged periods of continuous operation in order to gain critical information concerning catalyst lifetime and operation costs. If successful, the catalytic incinerator could become the standard treatment technology for chlorinated organic vapors.", ,,(520) 293-1500,,HAROLD BENTLEY,,(520) 293-1500,HAROLDB@HGCINC.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'organic compound', 'Drinking Water Act', 'study', 'birth defect', 'heart defect', 'water', 'high', 'liver problem', 'risk cancer', 'drinking water', 'proposal', 'technology', 'superfund site', 'catalytic converter', 'carbon dioxide', 'hydrochloric acid', 'technology', 'gas propane', 'catalytic converter', 'protect', 'implementation', 'catalytic converter', 'absorption', 'technology', 'contaminant site', 'transfer medium', 'disposal', 'laboratory', 'system field', 'period', 'information', 'operation', 'cost', 'catalytic incinerator', 'treatment technology']"

The derived solution will support satellite Factory Compatibility Test (FCT) for satellite programs utilizing the AFSCN.  Using open architecture, open standards, COTS software and hardware, and a modular approach to develop a largely software-based simulation platform will yield a more compact, lower cost, less complicated, and easily upgradable testing solution.  This test simulator will initially support AFSCN satellite compatibility testing, and be modular and upgradeable to support additional satellite testing for military, scientific, and commercial markets.  The Phase I investigations for this project will focus on identifying the capabilities required to provide ground system compatibility testing with the AFSCN and generating a complete requirements set for backwards TSTR compatibility.  The investigation will utilize these requirements, the current architecture, and current user needs to create a CONOPs and notional architectures.  These architectures will be evaluated to produce the most cost effective simulation solution for the USAF.    BENEFIT:  A user-friendly, easily deployable, and cost-effective AFSCN simulator provides the USAF with near-term cost savings for utilization, training, and sustainment.  Additionally, this system alleviates the demand for overburdened Mobile Range Flight (MRF) testing resources.  An upgraded simulator provides the USAF and other agencies with a simulation/test system that would benefit many satellite development programs through lower cost AFSCN compatibility testing.  KinetX envisions a simulator architecture that is modular, configurable and extensible to support multiple satellite programs testing needs.  This simulation architecture will also enable KinetX to commercialize this platform for the growing commercial satellite market.

For refractory metals such as tungsten (W) to be used in fusion applications, improvements in both mechanical and physical properties are needed.  Because recent work identified the benefits of nanosize, transition-metal-carbide dispersoids within tungsten, this project will develop fabrication techniques to enable the near net shape forming of nanograined W and W alloys, with improved resistance to embrittlement, for use in fusion reactors.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of producing near net shape W components comprised of ultra-fine grained microstructures.  Analyses of the samples showed that tungsten materials reinforced with transition metal carbide have a higher recrystallization temperature, experience less grain growth at elevated temperatures, and have higher hardness values than pure tungsten samples.  During Phase II, techniques developed during Phase I will be optimized and used to fabricate extensive material property specimens.  Rhenium additions will be evaluated to further improve ductility. Finally, plasma facing component mockups will be fabricated to demonstrate the scalability of the process.

For this reason, local air quality patterns and trends are often inaccessible to disadvantaged communities (DACs). Many technologies that will be used for deep decarbonization of industrial and power facilities have the added co-benefit of reducing non-CO2 pollutants, such as criteria air pollutants, but there is a lack of information regarding the economic, social, health, and climate benefits from these emissions reductions. The impacts of pollutants from point-source emitters often affect communities of lower socioeconomic status or composed of ethnic and racial minorities. Understanding the full suite of benefits offered by advanced decarbonization, such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen-fuel switching, will be important for advocate for equitable climate and energy solutions. We will develop the Local Climate and Air Quality Emissions Tracking Atlas (LOCAETA), an interface that enables local stakeholders, commercial users, urban researchers, and decision-makers to evaluate the impact of point-source emitters on local communities. We will apply machine learning to rapidly identify and characterize areas affected by point-sources and deploy atmospheric models to determine likely sources of pollutant transport at a neighborhood level. We will identify data sources necessary to quantify the impacts from point-source emitters in the state of Louisiana, which will serve as the initial proofing region before a larger geographic expansion that will eventually target nationwide data coverage. This analysis will be done using a range of public models and international, national, and regional datasets. LOCAETA will use 1) cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify relationships between pollutant concentrations, point-source emitters, public health trends, and environmental justice; 2) investigate local transport of primary pollutants using atmospheric dispersion models to evaluate impacts to environmental systems and human health; 3) create a free online interface that is optimized for ease-of-use to share these data products; and 4) develop a database of detailed impacts from point-source emitters to facilitate more accurate modeling of changes to earth and environmental systems regarding critical infrastructure, natural resource, and energy resilience. There are currently no publicly available, up-to-date inventory of pollutant impacts from point source emitters in North America. Existing products are limited by scope and or scale. We will develop an inventory with LOCAETA, which could have tremendous applications because of the importance of air pollutants on human health and the quantity of point-source emitters that will need to be decarbonized. Decisions informed by LOCAETA data could save thousands of lives per year and help the United States achieve its decarbonization goals.

The main focus of this project is to develop game-theoretic analytics and frameworks to support the Air Forces autonomy science & technology strategy (e.g., ""deterrence"" posture which in turn may be enabled by the attribute of resiliency) against counter space aggression. The Phase I effort has resulted in a SANDGT for persistent and risk-averse space situation awareness. We obtained the promising results to validate our developed approaches. These preliminary yet promising results clearly demonstrate that IFTs SANDGT provides innovative and effective game theoretical approach for persistent space denial. In the phase II project, we will revise, extend, and optimize the Phase I research results for realistic SSA scenarios considering the security issues in embedded satellite networks with Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) framework and the operational constraints of space-based visible/radar sensors, LEO/near GEO space platforms, maneuver capabilities, characteristics of orbital planes and space assets per plane on asset observability and reachability. Moreover, IFT team will extend and tie all the models developed in Phase 1 using SOA framework and Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) decision making paradigm.; BENEFIT: The proposed SANDGT for persistent and risk-averse space situation awareness has tremendous application potential in many military applications. It can be used to defensive counter space mission to protect high value space assets, and protect tactical space communications with dynamic spectrum sharing, routing adaptation and interference mitigations against kinetic and non kinetic threat.

To develop such a multi-sensor resource manager we have proposed an innovative combination of generalized multi-armed bandit algorithms and approximate dynamic programming to compute efficient far-sighted solutions of the sensor allocation and scheduling problem. The sensor manager is a model-based approach that can adapt easily to different sensor performance models or optimization criteria, allowing it to respond to different operating conditions and mission requirements.

EOS must look through the Earth?s atmosphere that induces systematic error in measuring the actual reflectance of ground targets through scatter and attenuation of light. Atmospherically-induced error affects data utility because the atmospheric aerosol content, i.e., humidity, dust, pollen, smoke particles, etc., fluctuates greatly, impacting applications for global monitoring, defense and agriculture. The value of data could make this a significant and growing market opportunity if the specifications are met successfully. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to correct aerosol-induced error in EOS data by reversing the effect, found empirically to be structured, independent of aerosol type and potentially predictable through measurement of dark target-reflectance ? water bodies clear of aquatic vegetation, entrained sediment and specular reflectance from windblown waves. The method of study is extraction and statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data, the standard reference for calibration and validation of data from all other EOS platforms. This problem is approached through a series of heuristic investigations to (1) reconstruct relationships of blue, green and red bands to near infrared (NIR) originally fitted using Landsat 5 and 7 data (longer wavelengths may not be addressed because they are resistant to atmospheric affects), (2) use these relationships to reverse the error, (3) develop methods to select, proof and apply dark targets that calibrate the correction, and (4) measure residual error by comparing post-algorithm reflectance to at-ground reflectance measured by portable spectrometry. The residual error is likely due to uncertainty associated with dark targets. Once developed and proofed, the algorithm will be brought to the Landsat 8 Cal/Val team for validation.

POC's modulator does not suffer from the shortcomings of state-of-the-art modulators such as nonlinearity, intermodulation products, harmonic distortion, or frequency chirping. Two preferred modulator configurations are proposed, and are considered to be ideally suited for dual use applications. These are: a plasmon EO modulator and a waveguide EO modulator. In the plasmon modulator, the EO polymer is external with respect to the channel waveguide, while in the waveguide modulator, the waveguide is made up of the EO polymer itself. After completion of the Phase I project, POC will focus in Phase II on expanding the results of Phase I by optimizing the fabrication and material processes to meet international standards of quality productization. Phase II will also include ehancing the performance characteristics of both modulators, and cost effectively expanding the application base beyond the U.S. market. The projected cost estimate of POC's modulator is less than $100 per unit, vs. tens of thousands of dollars for state-of-the-art modulators.

The ability to analyze and select out single cells based on secretions is particularly critical for the rapid development of monoclonal antibody therapies. This need was highlighted recently with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Distributed capabilities to screen and sort B-cells, hybridoma cells, and producer cells (e.g CHO) based on quantitative secretion phenotype can accelerate the discovery and development of therapeutic neutralizing antibodies and aid in production of antigenic proteins for vaccine development. A key challenge is the screening of producer cell lines for productivity, which can take months and require significant manual intervention. Emphasizing the critical need, several microfluidic platforms have been developed for the automated screening of antibody secreting cells. However, these systems require specialized expertise or commercial equipment that is not widely available, and the number of cells that can be analyzed remains small. Thus, there is a critical need for high- throughput cell screening workflows that do not rely on new capital equipment. To address this bottleneck, Partillion plans to transition a lab-on-a-particle technological breakthrough, highlighted as the SLAS Innovation Award winner in 2020, into our first reagent product that enables customers to use their standard flow sorter machines for the selection of producer cell lines that secrete antibodies and other recombinant products. Our technology is based on microscale crescent-shaped hydrogel nanovials which capture cells, are functionalized to capture secretions, and template the formation of millions of uniform drops within seconds, all with simple pipetting and centrifugation steps. These drops prevent the loss and cross-talk of secretions. Particles and associated cells can then be sorted with flow cytometers based on the amount of secreted product at much higher rates than current techniques. In this Phase I SBIR, we will engineer and validate our reagent-based product to work robustly with antibody producing CHO cell lines. We will develop workflows for compatibility on a number of standard, commercially available flow cytometers in order to ensure ease of adoption by a wider customer base. We will also increase single-cell loading efficiency of the nanovials, beating Poisson-governed loading by 30-fold, to reduce the number of cell doublets and increase throughput in order to be able to screen larger populations for rarer or more high-producing clones in a single run. At the completion of the proposed work we will have demonstrated the ability to sort through andgt; 1 million clones in a work day, orders of magnitude higher than current technologies. Successful completion of our project will result in reagents with immediate impact in enabling distributed development and production of antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.NARRATIVE We will develop accessible “lab on a particle” technology that enables the scalable selection of cell lines that produce more antibodies and other bio-products.

There are number of candidate cathode and anode materials are considered promising candidates for lithium ion battery due to their large capacity and relatively good rate capability, low self-discharge and relatively good capacity retention as well as ease of monitoring state of charge.  However, their cyclic life is still far from satisfying DOD&quot;s needs for space application as stated above.     Main challenges for current cathode materials include considerable deterioration of the cycle stability due to structural changes, dissolution of transition metal and oxygen; formation of passive layer from decomposition of electrolyte, impedance growth; and thermal instability of cathode material.

Therefore, a coupled approach involving both an analytical methodology for structural analysis and experimentally measured aerodynamic loads should be employed to predict individual component loads as well as the stress and strain field in critical locations.  These results can then be utilized for damage tolerance and failure prediction of the individual components.  The structural model should not only be able to capture the dynamic load experienced by components such as the pitch link, swashplate, hub or trailing edge flap but also detailed stress and strain field in each ply of the composite blade.

Deviations from as-molded and machined dimensions resulting from thermal excursions during processing can result in rejected parts. The aim of this program is to further develop and implement a modified processing scheme that will eliminate this particular problem. In order to achieve this goal, this program will focus on the thermal conditioning of the fiber reinforcement. Precise control of the thermal history of the reinforcement will result in improved dimensional stability.

However, a substantial breakthrough in breath testing is hampered by available instrumentation that is bulky, expensive and often not capable of real- time analysis. Isoprene is a volatile organic compound present in human breath. This endogenously formed substance is an indicator with non-invasive diagnostic potential. It has been related to cholesterol biosynthesis and may be used for mass screening of lipid disorders. Significantly, it has the potential to be applied in cancer screening. Vista Photonics, Inc. proposes to develop a compact, real-time medical isoprene breath analyzer. A specially designed laser source based on an external cavity diode laser will be developed. A derivative photoacoustic spectroscopy approach will be applied to achieve the required selectivity. This new optical instrument will allow selective determination of the isoprene concentration while suppressing other interfering breath components. This enabling feature will allow the analysis of untreated breath samples, which substantially reduces instrument complexity. The proposed instrument platform is especially suited to be applied for the selective optical detection of larger molecules possessing broad absorption bands. The high performance detection of these molecules may find widespread application beyond medical applications.

Using imaging guidance {CT, fluoroscopy, ultrasound or bronchoscopy) a sharp needle is advanced into a suspicious area and cells are aspirated into the needle.  These cells are then evaluated under a microscope and are characterized as benign, infectious or malignant.  There are over 169,500 cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and over 600,000 lung biopsies performed worldwide every year. The most common complication of this procedure is a lung collapse (pneumothorax), which occurs in 20-40% of cases. In greater than 10% of these lung collapses, the patient becomes symptomatic and requires chest tube placement and hospitalization.  The development of a novel biopsy needle tract sealant that will reduce or eliminate pneumothorax would be most valuable. Proof of principal was achieved during Phase I with great results.

The technology is crucial for a number of Army applications including video surveillance, Automatic Target Recognition and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. While feature-based or template matching-based classification algorithms are used in certain Army applications, it has been observed that their classification accuracy depends on the quality of the training dataset. Often the lack of a representative set of training images severely affects performance. Moreover, the algorithms generally perform poorly when the object is occluded. Each of these methods addresses certain aspects of recognition while ignoring others. Thus, there is a need for a psychologically inspired and comprehensive approach to object recognition. Research in Neuroscience has indicated that humans do not use one specific algorithm but simultaneously use a combination of multiple classification algorithms.

However, these advantages can only be accomplished by providing a towed minesweeping approach that allows the RHIB to adequately perform the required mission within its limited towing capacity. The Phase I program established a baseline approach for an electrically driven, towed Acoustic Source that was practical and readily deployable / recoverable. The Acoustic Source was slightly buoyant with a total system drag at 15 knots of less than 240 pounds. It used an array that consisted of twelve tuned piezoelectric ceramics transducers designed to cover a predetermined frequency band which collectively covered a spectrum of 20 Hz –10,000 Hz. One typical acoustic array element was fabricated and tested and the projected performance was verified in the band of interest. Each transducer element will be driven with a special amplifier than eliminates the requirement for large tuning inductors at the low frequencies. The Phase II program will refine the Phase I Acoustic Source by designing, developing and testing the critical sub-system components to establish a viable approach to fabricate a fully operational Acoustic Source for ocean testing in the following phases. BENEFITS: The overall DoD market need is considered very large for an acoustic source that can be readily adapted to various MCM, decoy and commercial applications. LewTech plans to pursue all these markets. We also plan to obtain required export licenses to pursue international opportunities with our major allies, such as the United Kingdom and Australia for similar systems.

The  device can be used for both endoscopic and open procedures. It can be used to transfer treatment plans from computer-based 3D surgical planning tools or cephalometric tracings onto the bone. The system will provide for intraoperative registration of the i mage to the patient, with no requirement for fiducial markers in the pre-operative images and no fixation frame attached to the head. Examples of procedures where OsteoMark might be used include minimally-invasive (endoscopic) reconstruction and distractio n osteogenesis. Once the marks are made, the surgeon will complete the procedure using instruments without any tracking, using the marks to guide the modification of bone. The proposed device will be less expensive and less complex than a system that track s the motion of multiple surgical instruments as procedures are performed. We are proposing to develop navigation based on both 2D and 3D pre-operative images, though Phase I will address only the 3D images. OsteoMark will be developed to interact with the  open-source medical imaging software Slicer/Osteoplan. In Phase I, we will fabricate the prototype marker, develop a rudimentary software interface for Slicer, and characterize its performance in a series of bench tests. The capstone feasibility demonstra tion will be a set of endoscopic procedures performed in porcine cadaver heads, from which we will quantify the performance of the marking device in an environment that closely resembles an operating-room. Public Health Significance: Minimally-invasive sur gery is becoming more widely used in reconstruction of bones in the face because it results in faster recovery times, less pain and discomfort, and less scarring than open procedures. Another recent advancement has been the use of computer graphics tools t o plan complex reconstruction operations. We are proposing to develop a device that will enable surgeons to copy computer treatment plans to the bone even through a very small incision, allowing surgeons to perform more sophisticated procedures with less d ifficulty for the patient.", ,,(978) 689-0003,sasso@psicorp.com, ,,() -,,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'clinical partner Dept Oral Maxillofacial Surgery', 'navigation orthognathic surgery', 'device', 'endoscopic open procedure', 'transfer treatment plan', 'computer-based 3d', 'surgical planning tool', 'tracing bone', 'system', 'fiducial marker', 'image fixation', 'procedure', 'instrument', 'modification bone', 'device', 'motion', 'surgical instrument procedure', 'pre-operative image', 'phase address 3d image', 'open-source medical imaging software Slicer/Osteoplan', 'phase', 'prototype marker', 'rudimentary software interface', 'performance', 'endoscopic procedure', 'performance', 'device environment', 'public health', 'reconstruction bone', 'fast recovery time', 'scarring open procedure', 'computer graphic tool', 'device', 'copy computer treatment plan', 'bone small incision', 'sophisticated procedure']"

This effort is motivated by the fact that no scenario definition language exists today that allows for easy inter-operability among simulators.  And yet, the need to rapidly induct pieces of a scenario or interact with another simulator and share scenario data is ever increasing.  Manual effort required to allow for semantic interoperability among scenarios is cost ineffective, tedious and error prone. We address these issues by developing the Extensible Scenario Management Language (ESML), an XML-based scenario definition and execution language that can support the comprehensive management of scenarios and their executions at different levels of abstraction.  We will develop a component-based Scenario Model Interoperability Toolkit (SMIT) that supports translation of scenario definitions and models from one format to another using ESML as the interlingua.  Model translation will itself be powered by an innovative ontology-driven translator code generator approach to ensure semantic interoperability. Finally, we will elaborately document the methodological changes required by instructors, students, tactical and strategic military analysts to develop, modify, and manage scenarios. BENEFITS: The proposed effort will be invaluable to instructors, students, and tactical and strategic military analysts.  ESML and SMIT will primarily be designed with (a) syntactic and semantic interoperability of simulation models and (b) scenario lifecycle management in mind.  ESML and SMIT will ensure not only huge savings in cost and time but will also ensure correctness.  This ensures model reuse across a wide range of simulation applications as well at various levels of abstraction.  ESML and SMIT can be applied to any future simulators used for distributed simulation exercises by organizations such as the Joint Operations Concepts (JOpsC) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) or the Navy Common Training Environment (NCTE) exercises. The developed technologies have huge commercial opportunity in any training environment that uses modeling and simulation to plan the training scenarios.  This includes first responder training systems in emergency management, disaster recovery and homeland security, police, border patrol, drug interdiction, etc.  There is a huge market potential in mission-critical nerve centers of defense and government facilities Finally, in mission critical space, air-traffic control and medical situations where scenario-based training systems are used for training, the developed technologies have a major role to play.",Donielle Mayer,Business Operations Manag,(979) 260-5274,dmayer@kbsi.com,RONALD FERNANDES,Senior Research Scientist,(979) 260-5274,rfernandes@kbsi.com,,,,"['language', 'suite tool methodology', 'semantic interoperability', 'simulation', 'vendor-specific tool', 'language', 'inter-operability simulator', 'simulator', 'manual', 'semantic interoperability', 'cost', 'error', 'issue', 'Extensible scenario Management Language', 'xml-based scenario definition execution language', 'management', 'level', 'abstraction', 'component-based scenario Model Interoperability Toolkit', 'translation scenario definition model', 'model', 'translation power', 'semantic interoperability', 'document', 'student', 'scenario', 'student', 'scenario', 'lifecycle management', 'cost time', 'model', 'simulation', 'abstraction', 'simulator', 'simulation exercise organization', 'Common training Environment', 'exercise', 'technology', 'training environment', 'modeling simulation plan', 'training scenario', 'responder training system', 'emergency management', 'disaster recovery', 'security', 'police', 'market', 'potential', 'mission-critical nerve center defense government facility', 'mission', 'training', 'technology']"

The biggest challenge of using the photocathode is that it has an extremely stringent requirement on the vacuum environment and can be destroyed by even low doses of residual gases in the chamber. Consequently, the transport of alkali antimonide photocathodes is eminently difficult. Furthermore, the cathode lifetime is limited by the residual gas in the photoinjector. An efficient encapsulation is needed to avoid contamination during transportation of cathodes, preserve their QE, and increase their lifetime. Euclid Techlabs PI: Dr. Ao Liu) and BNL PI: Dr. Erdong Wang) together propose to develop a thin-film deposition on the alkali antimonide photocathodes as an encapsulation, via the well-established RF magnetron sputtering, with sputtering enhancement techniques. The proposed encapsulation studies include research on the sputtering configuration and recipe, sputtering enhancement schemes, tests of QE and cathode lifetime, and material characterization. A thin film coating is the only viable encapsulation method other than physical encapsulation using tube encapsulation via a base plate or a cartridge. In Phase I, we will start with building a new sputtering source with a vendor, e.g. KJ Lesker, taking into account overall geometry and the available port size and distance to the photocathode surface. We will modify the magnetron details to cater to the vacuum requirements of lower than 10-9 torr and high baking temperature. Customized targets such as a h-BN target will be acquired. The system will be tested at Euclid before being shipped to BNL for installation. Meanwhile, Euclid will test the sputtering enhancement methods proposed in the previous sections, using the existing RF sputtering chambers. The technique can be applied to most of the alkali antimonide photocathode growth chambers, considering the easiness to add a customized sputtering system in the multi-port chambers. Users will benefit from the encapsulated photocathodes and their unaltered QE.

Indeed, a consensus report concerning FDA approval of the stents recommends the use of the pig model to assess these devices. However, a marked deficiency in current pig models is that they do not present with metabolic syndrome and significant atherosclerosis, underlying conditions that can drastically alter restenosis and thrombosis. Thus, the development of efficacious and safe stents continues to be confounded by the absence of asufficient large animal model of atherosclerosis. The ideal pig model would be of manageable size and manifest both metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis at an early age. Like mice, the pig genome can be efficiently manipulated to create hypomorphic andnull alleles by genome engineering. In this Phase 1 STTR we propose to generate a pig model of metabolic syndrome and rapid atherosclerosis by knocking out the low density lipoprotein receptor gene in a strain of minipigs (Ossabaw) with a genetic propensity for Type 2 diabetes. A strategy employing sequential gene targeting by homologous recombination using adeno-associated virus, and iterative cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer will result in the generation of LDLR-null minipigs during this Phase I STTR. Successful creation of OssabawLDLR -/- minipigs with evidence of enhanced dyslipidemia would justify submission of a Phase II STTR proposal focused on herd expansion, in-depth physiological characterization, and potentially commercialization of the model for sales to the biomedical research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This STTR proposes to create a pig model of metabolic syndrome and rapid atherosclerosis by knocking out the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in the Ossabaw minipig. Using a novel accelerated approach to gene inactivation, pigs without the LDLR gene will be generated during this Phase 1 STTR and their lipid profile will be examined for evidence of disrupted lipid processing. These pigs will be further characterized on the basis of subsequent funding, and if evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis is found, a population of pigs will be generated and provided for sale to the biomedical research community.",SCOTT FAHRENKRUG,,(612) 670-2078,fahre001@gmail.com,SCOTT FAHRENKRUG,,(612) 670-2078,scott@recombinetics.com,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'anatomy', 'regard size', 'morphology', 'relative collateral arterial supply', 'coronary arterial model', 'endovascular device', 'consensus report concern', 'model', 'device', 'model', 'metabolic syndrome', 'atherosclerosis', 'condition', 'development', 'animal model', 'atherosclerosis', 'model', 'size', 'metabolic syndrome', 'atherosclerosis', 'mouse', 'genome', 'model', 'metabolic syndrome', 'atherosclerosis', 'gene strain minipig', 'genetic propensity type 2 diabete', 'gene target', 'homologous recombination', 'adeno-associate virus', 'phase sttr', 'submission phase', 'proposal focus', 'expansion', 'commercialization model', 'biomedical research', 'public', 'health', 'model', 'metabolic syndrome', 'atherosclerosis', 'accelerated approach', 'lipid profile', 'lipid processing', 'atherosclerosis', 'biomedical research']"

It is irreversible if not treated by age 7, but half of all patients in the U.S. are undetected and untreated until after it is too late, making it the leading cause of preventable vision loss. Rebion (Rebiscan, Inc) has developed retinal birefringence scanning (RBS) into a commercial product, the RBS-based “blinq” device, which detects amblyopia and strabismus with 94% accuracy, compared with 69% accuracy of non-RBS methods.Although blinq effectively screens for strabismus and amblyopia by direct detection of these conditions with very high sensitivity (97%), published “specificity” of the device is closer to 87%. Given the 5% prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus, this means that 2 normal patients could potentially be referred for every treatable case. It is therefore essential that “specificity” of blinq be improved if the device is to be adopted widely. One likely cause of false referrals is corneal birefringence, which can interfere with an RBS test. Unlike retinal birefrigence, corneal birefringence can vary greatly between patients and cause inaccurate RBS results. If corneal birefringence could be neutralized as a factor in RBS, the specificity of the blinq device could likely be improved to equal or exceed the deviceandapos;s 97% sensitivity.Leading researchers at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) have developed a novel, patented approach that incorporates corneal birefringence compensation in an RBS system. This approach can be readily optimized within blinqandapos;s current mechanical and electrical design. In this Phase I study, we believe that by collaborating with the JHU research team, we will be able to develop a new device that produces significant advantages over existing technologies, including the commercially available blinq device.Applying JHUandapos;s research advancements to the FDA-cleared blinq device will allow rapid commercial adoption of a breakthrough technology for detection of amblyopia. The improved end result is that vision screening in the real world will immediately improve and save thousands of children from unnecessary vision loss.

In 2018, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths—a decrease of about 4.6% from 2017—but almost 70% of the deaths involved opioids. While overdoses related to prescription opioids have decreased, synthetic opioids made up over two-thirds of all opioid-related overdose deaths in 2018. West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Hampshire had the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in 2018. Furthermore, there are reported increases in overdose deaths that may result from isolation and access to drugs and treatment services related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this proposal is closely aligned with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to educate clinical providers and lay people on improving treatment and outcomes for those suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs), specifically in response to drug overdose.Many barriers have been identified for training providers on SUDs. Simulation-based training has shown promise for training providers about responding to drug overdose during Basic Life Support (BLS) training. However, simulation-based training is usually resource intensive and can be difficult to implement as current simulator technologies require facilities, staff, and technology support.Overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) is associated with improved outcomes for people experiencing opioid overdose as well as decreased drug use by people who participated in OEND programs. Increasing access to OEND could expand these positive results.This Phase II SBIR aims to further develop Lumis’s Augmented Reality Training on Overdose (ART-OD) within Lumis’s existing healthcare training simulator, the InSight Platform.

Although much technology input has gone into blades, the technology for towers has been at a virtual standstill.  This is especially true for large Megawatt-size turbines, because the cost of the steel and concrete towers constitutes 30% of their cost.  This project will develop technology for manufacturing composite towers on-site, providing major savings in transport and labor.  A telescoping composite tower design will be used to help with the lifting tasks for the nacelle and blades.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of a new family of towers that can be completely manufactured in the field.  The feasibility of tower erection without the need for a tall crane also was established.  Lastly, the tower was designed to allow easier mounting of the nacelle and easier installation of the blades.  Phase II will create and certify a 26-meter-tall proof-of-concept composite tower for mating with the nacelle.

SST eliminates scattered radiation from the measurement thereby doubling image resolution and contrast using less than half the dose of standard mammography. MammoCAT can be applied to standard planar digital mammography (DM) and to newer mammography techniques such as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and breast computed tomography (BCT). This proposal seeks enrollment in the NIH/NCI I-Corps program to help determine our introductory product through an understanding of clinician preferences for each system, the impact of pricing and reimbursement and help craft our product launch strategy. Mammography continues to be an important diagnostic tool for breast cancer screening and diagnosis and has helped save thousands of lives. Unfortunately, not every woman who gets routine screening is saved by mammography and an unacceptably large number of women are subjected unnecessary testing, biopsy and treatment due to false positives. Our innovative approach to scatter free high speed, high resolution detection will help MammoCAT improve the sensitivity and specificity of mammography whilst also improving the efficiencies of breast cancer detection and diagnosis by removing the need for additional or alternative testing before therapy can be rendered. We believe MammoCAT CT will usher in a new era where every woman will benefit from mammography and where tumors can be detected, diagnosed and biopsied in the same device thus improving equipment and space utilization and hospital workflow.PROJECT NARRATIVE Fischer Imaging’s proposed MammoCAT will improve breast cancer screening, diagnosis and biopsy by finding missed cancers, reducing unnecessary treatment, improving patient experience and the accuracy of biopsy. The device will additionally allow comprehensive patient care by allowing breast cancer screening, diagnosis and biopsy using the same device thus removing the need for multiple devices and multiple scheduling and/or transfer from one facility to another. As a start-up company, ensuring success in the mammography space requires that we consider the fastest route to launching a marketable product. The I-corps program provides an excellent avenue for helping us decide on the configuration of this product, our product launch strategy and validate our overall business model.",WES ROGERS,,(470) 297-7299,wrogers@fischermti.com,SHABBIR BAMBOT,,(678) 907-4711,shabbirb@aol.com,,,,"['Fischer Imaging', 'device', 'proprietary Slot Scanning Technology', 'radiation measurement', 'double image resolution', 'planar digital mammography', 'mammography technique digital breast tomosynthesis', 'breast computed tomography', 'proposal', 'enrollment', 'i-corps program', 'introductory product', 'preference system', 'impact', 'pricing reimbursement', 'launch strategy', 'diagnostic tool', 'breast cancer', 'screening diagnosis', 'woman subject', 'testing', 'biopsy treatment', 'false positive', 'innovative approach', 'high', 'speed', 'high resolution', 'detection', 'sensitivity', 'efficiency', 'breast cancer', 'detection', 'diagnosis', 'alternative testing therapy', 'mammocat ct usher', 'tumor', 'detect', 'equipment space', 'NARRATIVE Fischer Imaging', 'breast cancer', 'diagnosis biopsy', 'miss cancer', 'unnecessary treatment', 'accuracy', 'biopsy', 'device', 'patient care', 'breast cancer', 'diagnosis biopsy use device', 'device', 'transfer facility', 'fast route launch marketable product', 'i-corps program', 'configuration', 'product', 'business model']"

The protocolized but blind provision of large volumes of blood products, while beneficial in aggregrate, can often exacerbate coagulopathy and worsen outcomes. Many warfighters die because the specific coagulopathies are not rapidly diagnosed, and since 30% of victims of uncontrolled hemorrhage die within the first hour, caregivers cannot supply targeted therapy quickly enough to effect outcome.

With thulmium as the doping ion, wavelenghts in the 450-560 nm range are readily realized as was already demonstrated, mostly in fluoride crystals and glasses.  We propose alternative host crystals which, based on calculations by Dr. Gruber, our collaborator on this project, have more optimal conditions for upconversion when doped with Tm, due to favorable branching ratios and cross sections.  Another key element in our approach is the use of crystal fibers which are known to possess low thresholds and are therefore highly advantageous for the transitions considered, some of which are quasi-three-level by nature.  While the proposed project targets the 450-460 nm spectral range, extention to other wavelengths in the blue, blue-green and red region are possible using alternative active ions (such as erbium and praesidymium) based on the same general concept of upconversion in crystal fiber lasers.",Hanna Hoffman ,,() -,,Hanna Hoffman ,,() -,,San Jose State University,,,"['diode laser', 'doped-crystal fiber', 'performance', 'system', 'nonlinear element', 'resistance damage', 'laser medium', 'fluoride crystal glass', 'host', 'crystal', 'base calculation Dr. Gruber', 'condition', 'branching ratio', 'cross section', 'crystal fiber', 'threshold', 'quasi-three-level nature', 'target', 'wavelength blue', 'active ion', 'erbium praesidymium', 'crystal fiber']"

This project has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays. Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays. Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. XFlow Energy's novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated. Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural simulation of a 500 W turbine. This design will be prototyped and will undergo thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately. The objective of SBIR Phase I is to produce a 500 W turbine that is thoroughly characterized, can survive up to 100 mph winds, and is ready for commercialization. This design will inform development of a utility-scale turbine (>50 kW) which will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.

This toolkit is predicated on the fact that modern PCs and displays (either CRT-based or flat screen) have sufficient computing power, resolution, and stability to function as reliable measurement tools. A major advantage of PC use for vision testing is that measurement software can be equipped with a high level of fault tolerance. Automated test routines including criterion-free and forced-choice procedures, catch trials, Bayesian threshold approximation, and other sophisticated psychophysical techniques can greatly alleviate the need for highly-trained technicians, and the operator's main task can be to make sure that the test subject is cooperative. This fault tolerance does not automatically extend to the setup and calibration of hardware, however. Screen intensity and chromaticity, test distance, room illumination, and a number of other variables can have a significant effect on test thresholds, even when testing the same subject on the same PC under similar conditions. We propose to develop a set of simple hardware tools and control software that will allow necessary hardware calibrations and setup to be performed quickly, reliably, reproducibly, and with a very modest level of training on the part of the operator. Under this phase I application we will design a prototype toolkit with hardware based on off-the-shelf components and software with a relatively primitive user interface. Under the subsequent phase II application we will develop a fully integrated hardware prototype, a fault-tolerant software package with a user-friendly interface, and a detailed product development and commercialization plan. The final product of this STTR program will be twofold: A single user version that allows psychophysicists, experimental psychologists, optometrists, and other professionals to calibrate their PCs for any visual function test purpose; and an OEM version that can be packaged by any visual function test software developer to deliver a turn-key test system for clinicians, rural health centers, school districts, etc. Such packaged vision tests and toolkits will bring the benefit of precise and efficient vision assessment to almost any place where a PC can be set up",,,(763) 463-4814,thendrickson@ame-corp.com,GISLIN DAGNELIE,,(410) 614-4822,gdagnelie@jhmi.edu,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'phase sttr', 'hardware', 'personal computer', 'control vision test instrument', 'crt-based flat screen', 'computing power', 'resolution', 'stability function', 'measurement tool', 'vision testing measurement', 'level', 'criterion-free forced-choice procedure', 'bayesian threshold approximation', 'psychophysical technique', 'setup calibration hardware', 'test distance', 'room illumination', 'variable significant', 'threshold', 'test subject', 'condition', 'control software', 'hardware', 'level', 'training operator', 'phase application design', 'prototype toolkit hardware', 'user interface', 'phase', 'integrated hardware', 'prototype', 'fault-tolerant software package user-friendly interface', 'product', 'development', 'commercialization plan', 'product sttr', 'professional calibrate pc visual function test', 'OEM version package', 'visual function test', 'test system', 'school district', 'package vision test', 'vision assessment']"

The current  gold standard  diagnostic method for SFI culturing of affected tissue or bloo d   requires days to weeks and fails in over half of the tests. Diagnostic alternatives on the market generally have low sensitivities and/or lack specificity (suffer from false-negative and false-positive values). Physicians treating fungal infection want  to know the species responsible for the disease but they unanimously agree that there is an urgent need for a quick and reliable, sensitive and specific, yes/no diagnostic for SFI in order to start or not start treatment and save lives. Ergosterol is an a ccepted biomarker for fungi and yeasts and is absent in humans and animals. It thus represents an ideal SFI diagnostic analyte and, if quantified, a potential tool to monitor disease treatment as well as advance fungal disease biomedical research. Ergoster ol has not been used for SFI diagnosis, probably because it is not immunogenic and no assay suitable for clinical use is available. Semorex has developed a direct approach for targeting ergosterol, involving selective chemical tagging of ergosterol without  tagging closely similar substances. In preliminary research, Semorex established (via a proprietary HPLC assay for fluorescently labelled ergosterol) the proof-of-principle for this approach using clinical samples and several fungal strains. During Phase  I larger numbers of clinical samples from patients with and without fungal disease will be tested in order to establish the generality or limitations of this approach. In addition, the chemistry that facilitates the HPLC analysis will be adapted for the de velopment of a novel lateral flow device (LFD, or strip assay) based upon a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) instead of an antibody to bind the tagged ergosterol adduct. An LFD assay based upon MIPs will be robust, long-lived and inexpensive. If success ful, the anticipated LFD product (which will be developed with an identified manufacturing and marketing partner during Phase II) should compete well with antibody-based (insufficient sensitivity) or PCR-based (expensive and difficult to perform) products  for SFI assay and, we believe, revolutionize SFI testing. Furthermore, we anticipate that this device will pave the way for other MIP-based robust and high-performance LFDs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a new method for the rapi d and accurate diagnosis of systemic fungal infection, an increasingly common disease taking the lives of many patients. Current methods are slow and/or inadequate. Preliminary results indicate that the new approach, which detects ergosterol, a molecule th at is present in fungus cell walls and is absent in humans and animals, may answer physicians' urgent need for a quick, reliable yes/no answer when treating patients having potential fungal disease.", ,,(908) 322-7675,kastons@verizon.net, ,,() -,,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'disease', 'gold standard', 'diagnostic method', 'tissue bloo', 'half test', 'low', 'sensitivity', 'false-negative false-positive value', 'physician', 'disease', 'sensitive', 'specific', 'treatment', 'fungi', 'animal', 'disease treatment', 'fungal disease', 'biomedical research', 'Ergoster ol use sfi', 'diagnosis', 'clinical use available', 'target', 'tagging', 'phase   ', 'hplc analysis', 'de velopment', 'lateral flow device (', 'strip assay', 'base molecularly imprinted polymer', 'antibody bind', 'tag ergosterol', 'LFD product', 'manufacturing', 'marketing partner phase', 'antibody-based', 'sensitivity', 'pcr-based', 'sfi testing', 'device', 'high-performance lfd', 'public', 'health', 'proposal', 'method', 'diagnosis', 'disease life', 'detect', 'fungus cell wall', 'animal', 'answer physician', 'fungal disease']"

One key feature of this transmission and reception capability is the VLF radio, capable of broadcasting worldwide by use of ground transmitters and propagating radio waves.  Despite the challenges of launching a VLF signal, the VLF radio has a number of advantages including omni-directional long-range propagation, and low diffraction. Given the importance of reliable VLF communication, the Air Force needs a militarized VLF antenna designed for airborne use and capable of reliable operation in a Nuclear Command Control and Communications (NC3) environment.  Despite the robustness of VLF transmission and reception there are still issues that impede a sensor&quot;s ability to receive emergency-action messages effectively. These include the Electromagnetic Pulse from a local event, Ducted EMP through the aircraft structure, Aircraft Electromagnetic Interference, Nuclear Scintillation, Jamming and Natural atmospheric events such as lightning. SARA, using their extensive experience in both VLF sensor development and EMI\EMP mitigation proposes a two-pronged approach: advancement of VLF receive antenna magnetometers, and advancement in EMI\EMP reducing treatments, to meet the Air Force&quot;s NC3 needs.     BENEFIT:  The successful completion of the Phase I program provides a baseline and defines the future development process of the VLF receive antenna system. It does this by defining the system inputs, the sensors current state of the art, possible future system performance, and demonstrates a new high payoff technique for noise and clutter cancellation. The Phase I program produces a base for a focused development effort for obtaining a new more capable VLF communication system for the Air Force&quot;s Nuclear Command Control and Communications (NC3) needs.",Parviz Parhami,Chief Executive Officer,(714) 224-4410,pparhami@sara.com,Michael Zintl,Principal Investigtor,(714) 224-4410,mzintl@sara.com,,,,"['ABSTRACT', 'transmission', 'message bomber', 'reconnaissance', 'post', 'nuclear attack', 'radio', 'ground transmitter', 'radio wave', 'signal', 'omni-directional', 'low', 'diffraction', 'communication', 'design', 'operation', 'Nuclear Command Control Communications', 'transmission', 'sensor&quot;s ability', 'emergency-action', 'message', 'electromagnetic pulse local event', 'aircraft structure', 'aircraft', 'electromagnetic', 'jamming natural atmospheric event', 'sensor', 'development', 'mitigation', 'two-pronged approach', 'treatment', 'completion phase program', 'development process', 'antenna system', 'system', 'input', 'sensor current state', 'system', 'performance', 'payoff technique', 'noise', 'phase program', 'communication system', 'Nuclear Command Control Communications']"

This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production. The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.

DRIVE,,Lebanon,NH,03756-1000,DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   In both animal proof of concept studies and preliminary clinical trials  there is ample data demonstrating the potential therapeutic benefits o CD    blockade for treatment of GVHD  organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases  However  development of  CD    as a therapeutic has been impeded by antibody toxicity observed in early clinical trials     GVHD is a complication of allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  HSCT   GVHD remains a major cause of mortality in approximately     of patients who survive andgt    year post transplant  The standard of care is limited to drugs that need to be taken long term  work moderately well and are associated with significant side effects  There is therefore profound unmet need and significant potential for drugs that are safe and efficacious  Studies in GVHD have demonstrated that anti CD    acts as a prophylactic and is effective as a monotherapy as demonstrated in NHP where permanent allograft tolerance can be achieved using short courses of treatments comprised of  CD    alone  This strategy eliminates the use of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors both of which are associated with numerous side effects   CD    thus has a competitive advantage as most other drugs in development will require some form of combination therapy with either steroids or calcineurin inhibitors  A similar opportunity for improved clinical outcomes due to effective induction of tolerance exists in recipients of solid organ transplants  Furthermore  virtually all autoimmune disease models can be effectively ameliorated with  CD    therapy  with long term remission observed  We will target GVHD and chronic rejection associated with transplantation as our first clinical indication for commercial development     Existing studies strongly suggest that domains within the Fc region of the  CD    mAb contribute to its toxicity and therapeutic capacity  When toxicity was observed in the clinic and retrospectively in NHP  modifications were made to the antibody  while these modifications eliminated toxicity in NHP  the efficacy of  CD    as a tolerogenic antibody also was significantly reduced  As a result  development programs for  CD    as a therapeutic stalled  In Phase   studies we identified modifications that resulted in safe and efficacious versions of  CD    as tested in murine models  The goal of this proposal is to build on those observations and generate variant forms of the  human CD    antibody that retain the beneficial tolerogenic effects of  CD    while greatly reducing or eliminating toxicity  Variant forms of the antibody will be evaluated for both safety and efficacy in NHP models  Successful proof of concept in NHP transplant models will be the basis for creating a novel therapeutic  which could have far reaching impacts on the treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Development of  CD    as a therapeutic for autoimmune diseases and transplantation has shown great promise in human clinical trials but development has been hindered by problems with antibody toxicity  In the past  when toxicity was reduced  the efficacy of the antibody was dramatically decreased leading to the suspension of developmental programs  This project will engineer new variants of the  CD    antibody that will eliminate toxicity while maintaining tolerogenicity  thus allowing the potential of  CD    to be harnessed as a novel treatment for a wide range of

The goal is to develop a tool which can accurately handle multiphysics simulations, both in analysis mode, and for design optimization purposes.  The approach will rely on high-order (up to 6th order) Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in space and second-order backwards difference as well as higher-order (up to 5th order) implicit Runge-Kutta temporal discretizations.  Efficient solution techniques will be employed in order to make these methods competitive with current simulation tools in terms of required computational resources.  The favorable asymptotic properties of these methods, combined with the use of unstructured meshes, will enable accurate simulation of complex phenomena with wide ranges of scales from first principles.  BENEFIT:   The use of high-order methods will deliver much higher accuracy for complex multi-scale problems while using coarser underlying grids.  This in turn will reduce discretization errors to manageable levels, providing superior reliability in numerical analysis and optimization problems, while at the same time relieving the grid generation bottleneck for high resolution calculations, and enhancing scalability on massively parallel multi-core architectures.

Reducing allergen exposure is a primary goal of asthma management, yet there are no simple tests that enable allergic patients and consumers to measure allergen exposure in the home. In Phase I, the feasibility of using a lateral flow test for mite Group 2 allergen as part of home based allergen detection kit was demonstrated. The test detected mite allergen in dust samples within 10 minutes, correlated with enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) results, and was used to monitor allergen levels in homes and changes in allergen levels following an intervention procedure (steam cleaning). The aims of Phase II are to optimize tests for mite allergen and to investigate the hypothesis that using the test as a tool to educate patients about allergen exposure will encourage implementation and compliance with allergen avoidance procedures. The predictive value of tests for mite Group 1 and Group 2 allergens will be compared to select the optimal test for allergen assessment. A randomized controlled trial will study allergic patients compliance with avoidance procedures, comparing patients who use the mite test on a regular basis, with those who have educational materials but no test. Rapid tests will be developed for cat, dog and cockroach allergens, with the aim of producing a single allergen test card for multiple allergens that can be used to screen for allergen exposure in the home. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Effective consumer tests for allergens are not available. INDOOR Biotechnologies will market the test through distributors that sell allergen control products, indoor air quality testing services, and household cleaning products. Several companies have expressed strong interest in marketing the allergen tests. Our goals are to market 100,000 tests by the end of Phase II.

The modular system will allow for the incorporation of other low-cost devices, such as off-the-shelf temperature or CTD sensors. In addition, a low-cost communications module will be designed, which will facilitate communications via cell phone technology or radio transceivers for terrestrial, estuary, and coastal applications.       This system will target institutions participating in ocean color validation programs, specifically observing and understanding the role of the oceans in global climate change.

The goal is to develop the capability to sort aluminum into its exact alloy designations. The technology is expected to sort materials in less than 50-milliseconds per item automatically without operator intervention while the scrap is in motion on a high-speed conveyor belt. The scrap recycling industry reports that more than 30 billion pounds of nonferrous metals are produced each year in the U.S. alone. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) reports that more than 10 billion pounds of these nonferrous metals are discarded each year in landfills, because recycling is either technically or economically impractical. Existing methods of sortation that employ visual examination and hand sortation, or alternatively employ heavy media separation, cannot sort aluminum by alloy type. Refining is accomplished in smelting facilities that are expensive to build and often polluting. Using advanced spectrographic detection techniques, including computer analysis; the proposed technology will improve alloy identification accuracy and automatically sort aluminum metal alloys at speeds never before attainable.       The commercial impact of this project will be increased scrap utilization, increased scrap value, reduced pressure on non-renewable resources, and reduced environmental pollution.

Utilizing forward based airborne platforms will allow rapid detection and tracking of these threats with the potential to engage interceptors in the launch or boost phase. We propose an integrated solution which is based on the composition of an advanced inference framework and an advanced manifold learning based characterization algorithm. Our inference framework is capable of not only performing non-linear, non-Gaussian filtering, but also simultaneously performing tracking and discrimination through kinematic data. Our characterization algorithm operates on complex data in a sensor-agnostic fashion and can easily be extended to perform multi-sensor fusion even across wavelength regimes.

NIV provides breathing support without the use of an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. NIV is delivered by interfaces (a mask or nasal prongs). Generally, masks only cover the nose to mitigate potential aspiration concerns should a patient vomit. Nasal prongs are intended to achieve a 100% occlusive fit within a patient’s nare. For both masks and prongs, the goal is to deliver airway support maintaining positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Poorly fitting masks can lead to non-compliance, patient–ventilator dys‐synchronies, skin damage, pain, craniofacial skeletal issues, and can also result in delivery of sub-optimal pressures or tidal volume, which can adversely affect ventilation outcomes, particularly in the home care setting. Additionally, poorly fitting NIV interfaces can require them to be strapped to patients tightly to offset the inferior fit, which can lead to pressure ulcers, skin damage, or septum injury (in the case of nasal prongs). While many NIV delivery methods exist for neonatal patients (3 available mask and 11 nasal prong sizes), there are no sizes designed specific to young pediatric patients (1 month to 9 years old) that are equipped with appropriate headgear. The validation process to stand up a manufacturing approach is costly and time consuming for a relatively small market, limiting the interest of major manufacturers to fill these gaps. Three main limitations arise when addressing the needs of younger patients: 1) the size gap between neonatal and adult interfaces leave poor solutions for young pediatric patients, 2) variation in patient facial structure results in NIV interfaces being pushed too firmly against the face in an attempt to eliminate or reduce air leakage, and 3) craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) (e.g. cleft lip) further limit the ability to achieve a good seal. An approach is needed that will produce NIV interfaces that address these gaps, while being FDA-compliant and still economically feasible. Phase I. Hypothesis. Pediatric-specific sized NIV mask and prongs can be manufactured using 3D printing methods to improve ventilation outcomes in benchtop models. Aim 1. Verify improved performance of pediatric-sized NIV devices fabricated through facial scanning and injection molding process. Aim 2 – Formulation development and testing for direct 3D printing approach. Phase II. Hypothesis. Manufacturing NIV devices with 3D printing yields better fitting interfaces that improve NIV outcomes in young pediatrics. Aim 3 – Validate manufacturing approach for pediatric NIV interfaces. Aim 4 – Finalize direct 3D print approach and evaluate performance with CFAs. Aim 5 – Multi-site human clinical evaluations (CHOP, n=29; ACH, n=24)Project Narrative: Relevance – Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is used to provide breathing support without the challenges encountered with an endotracheal tube. NIV is delivered either by masks or prongs. A tight seal is critical, but without having to pull the mask so tight that it generates pressure sores.

Safeguards provide assurances to the international community that nuclear materials and facilities are not being used for the illicit manufacture of nuclear weapons. To deter the proliferation of nuclear weapons, advanced technologies for rapid analysis of elemental and isotopic signatures are needed to detect the misuse of nuclear materials. How this problem is being addressed This project will leverage and advance NNSA technology developed at the DOE National Laboratories for advanced rapid elemental and isotopic analysis using laser ablation sampling with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). By coupling Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectroscopy (LAMIS) with ICP-MS analysis, improved precision, reduced influence of isobaric interferences, and additional lighter elements and isotopic signatures can be rapidly measured in one instrument platform. What will be done A viable approach to expand ICP-MS analytical capability is to utilize additional simultaneous technologies to complement such measurements. The proposed research will address: signal correlation from LIBS/LAMIS with LA-ICP-MS to improve measurement precision; expand light-element/isotope coverage; offer wider dynamic range of analysis through data fusion; development of an automated warning indicator for ICP-MS isobaric interference; and fabrication of a prototype commercial instrument for rapid elemental and isotopic analysis of heterogeneous materials. Phase I will establish proof of concept for improving precision, eliminating interferences and for additional elemental/isotopic signatures related to Safeguards. Phase II will develop a commercial instrument for testing at PNNL. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits The proposed capability and instrument will benefit the international Safeguards community with a powerful tool for measuring every element and isotope in samples without sample preparation. Rapid analytical measurements of nuclear materials are critical for NWAL and IAEA needs. Our approach of an integrated instrument for measuring every element on the periodic chart has significant potential for many other commercial applications, including biological imaging, geochemical age dating, and Advanced Manufacturing in industry.

However, current data storage systems are limited in terms of both storage capacity and access time.  This project will develop a novel three-dimensional volume, fast access holographic data storage system.  The proposed system is based on unique speckle-encoded reference beam multiplexing in 90-degree recording geometry, which overcomes the limitations of the current holographic optical memory technology.  Phase I performed a system design and analysis, selected key components, constructed a laboratory breadboard, and conducted a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration.  The recording and retrieval of holograms in 90 degree geometry, with a two-dimensional shift-multiplexed speckle-encoded reference beam in a photorefractive crystal recording medium, was successfully demonstrated.  In Phase II, a fully-operational, prototype three-dimensional holographic archival memory system will be designed and developed.  The system will consist of a holographic recording/retrieval optoelectronic assembly with a removable holographic medium module and an electronic interface for users.  The system will be capable of storing 100 terabits of data at a data rate of 10 gigabits per second.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new high capacity, high speed, holographic memory system should lead to ultrahigh-capacity data storage with the capability of random access at high speed as well as content-addressable search without moving the recording medium.

Compared to detailed kinetic mechanisms, reduced mechanisms offer computational tractability but typically compromise accuracy to enable use across a broad range of thermochemical regimes. Most applications, however, only traverse a small thermochemical subspace and would be best served by a problem-dependent reduced mechanism. Hence, ATA Engineering, Inc., (ATA) proposes to develop a software framework to enable automatic, on-demand creation of reduced kinetic mechanisms, optimized to problem-defined thermochemical states using flexible criteria. This framework will incorporate uncertainty propagation from an experimental database and perform automated reduction, optimizing based on automated low-order reactor simulations within the desired thermochemical state space. To facilitate the development of high-quality reduced mechanisms for kerosene-based rocket fuels, ATA and its partners at Texas A&M University (TAMU) will develop a comprehensive shock tube ignition delay measurement campaign, to be executed in Phase II, to reduce experimental uncertainty in critical, untested thermochemical domains for mixed-hydrocarbon rocket fuels.

Due to limited access to acknowledged foreign sites, remote detection of illicit behavior is becoming increasingly critical for mission success. Hyperspectral Imaging is a modality that generally enables remote characterization of a material by measuring its radiance return as a function of wavelength, which is distinct for every chemical. Algorithms to separate the target source from the background and atmosphere allow users to deduce the chemical makeup of ground materials and their quantities in order to detect manufacturing processing and infer quantities of licit or illicit materials being produced. The Phase I and initial Phase II of this project focused on developing a variety algorithms for detection, identification, and characterization of materials and a integrating them into a commercialized workflow optimization framework. One class of algorithms extended hyperspectral imaging capabilities from visible wavelengths through long-wave infrared for both solid and thin-plume gaseous targets. Novel atmospheric compensation methods were studied and implemented, focusing on the purely reflective and the purely thermal regimes. Critically, extensive studies of the effects of errors in atmospheric compensation and background subtraction on quantification and detection metrics were completed in all wavelength regimes. Plans for the Phase IIA project consist of extending algorithms completed in Phase II into other mission-relevant regimes, including detection of optically thick gaseous plumes and atmospheric compensation in the mid-wave infrared in which there is a mix of reflective and thermal radiance. In addition, co-indication analysis originally proposed for Phase II will be studied using a mix of liquid and gaseous effluents using extensive Deepwater Horizon Oil spill datasets. This will require the implementation of thin-film liquid detection algorithms. The benefits of this improved framework with measurements in the spectrally rich mid-wave infrared region as well as co-indication analysis of all types of effluents will be realized in a further strengthening of capabilities in confirming the presence of nuclear threats. The phenomenology developed for the detection of thick gaseous plumes will also allow for the determination of the extent of nuclear fallout particles in the event of a nuclear/chemical weapon attacks. In addition to non-proliferation efforts, commercialization of the framework in Phase III and beyond can apply directly to programs across the intelligence community from agricultural, environmental and climate monitoring, detection of illegal mining activities, or the discovery of illicit activities such as drug manufacturing by local law enforcement.",Sarah Wilt,,(571) 255-4090,swilt@arete.com,Kyle Ausfeld,,(818) 885-2207,kausfeld@arete.com,,,,"['Remote Detection Program', 'task', 'technical capability', 'detection', 'identification', 'detect', 'nuclear threat', 'nuclear test treaty', 'foreign site', 'remote', 'detection', 'illicit behavior', 'Hyperspectral Imaging modality', 'remote', 'algorithm', 'target', 'source', 'ground material', 'detect', 'manufacturing processing', 'illicit material', 'phase initial phase', 'algorithm detection', 'identification', 'characterization material', 'workflow optimization framework', 'class algorithm', 'hyperspectral imaging', 'wavelength long-wave infrared solid', 'target', 'atmospheric compensation method study', 'study effect', 'wavelength regime', 'plan', 'algorithm complete phase', 'detection', 'atmospheric compensation mid-wave infrared', 'co-indication analysis', 'phase', 'study', 'use mix', 'Oil spill', 'implementation', 'thin-film liquid detection algorithm', 'framework measurement', 'spectrally rich mid-wave infrared region', 'co-indication analysis type', 'nuclear threat', 'detection', 'determination', 'nuclear fallout particle event', 'nuclear/chemical weapon', 'attack', 'non-proliferation', 'commercialization framework phase', 'program', 'intelligence', 'environmental climate', 'detection', 'illegal mining activity', 'illicit activity', 'drug manufacturing']"

Maintenance of these aircraft is an integral part in keeping the fleet operational. Defects greatly impact the stability and integrity of the aircraft and can directly affect its performance. Since most of these defects and fractures occur beneath the skin on the plane, visual inspection is insufficient. Eddy current testing (ECT) is one of the NDI technologies that can be used for this detection and classification. The present method of ECT inspection of aircraft requires two separate scans at different frequencies. Running two scans and changing the scanning apparatus leads to long, costly maintenance times. A faster and more efficient way to do NDI is necessary to decrease the cost of maintenance and the downtime of each aircraft. RMD will address this by developing a hybrid multimode ECT-based scanning technology, which will have higher sensitivity than traditional ECT methods, and scan multiple frequencies simultaneously. This hybrid technology has the potential will reduce the inspection time to one half to one quarter of the time presently needed to inspect an airplane. RMD will work with Wyle Aerospace to develop new hybrid sensors for rapid non-destructive inspection of large aircraft. ; BENEFIT: The NDI system that RMD is developing is a breakthrough in eddy current testing that will reduce the time to perform to less than half the time required using existing commercial technology. Our technology can be used for a variety of NDI procedures on both military and commercial aircraft. These include:  Detection of subsurface flaws in aircraft  Evaluating bonded lap joints  Cyclic loading to discover cracks  Inspection of welds  Testing of axles and wheels in trains  Measurement of graphite nodularity in cast iron  Detection of variations in alloy, heat treatment, case depth, and the hardness of various metals RMD anticipates a five year commercialization plan, two years during the Phase II period, plus three years product development, marketing and sales ramp-up. During Phase I, we will identify and characterize market segments. We will establish detailed marketing and business strategies for the most promising market areas using company funds during Phase II. We will develop products that meet the needs of the Air Force.

In particular, as new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations become more prevalent, methodologies to quantify performance of both human-centered and autonomous operations will be required. The objective of this work is to discover opportunities for improvement in operations of the National Airspace System (NAS), using methods that advance the state of the art and that can be applied to both current and future operations. To that end, Mosaic ATM proposes to develop a tool that will characterize and classify the efficiency of airspace operations, with a focus on airport metroplex operations. We propose to leverage the latest in machine learning techniques to create supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, which will be trained and validated using large sets of archived flight and weather data. These models will be able to identify the most critical causal factors for degraded performance conditions, in a way that is comprehensible to an analyst. We will provide a user interface to explore the model results and causal factors. This work will support planning for UAM operations as well as informing NASA and other stakeholders where further investments in NAS automation are most warranted.</p>",Chris Stevenson,,(540) 454-7458,stevenson@mosaicatm.com,Michelle Eshow,Principal Analyst,(800) 405-8576,meshow@mosaicatm.com,,,,"['style=""margin-left:0', 'margin-right:0', 'A3.02 request', 'ldquo;autonomous system', 'system', 'capability', 'data mining', 'datum discovery', 'traffic', 'level', 'performance', 'traffic', 'vehicle', 'performance', 'operation', 'National Airspace system', 'nas', 'method', 'operation', 'tool', 'efficiency', 'airspace operation', 'focus airport metroplex', 'operation', 'unsupervised machine learning model', 'flight weather datum', 'model', 'performance', 'user interface', 'model', 'causal factor', 'operation', 'stakeholder', 'investment', 'automation']"

Phase I research resolved fine structure of the emission spectrum from 2-D photonic crystals showing that the high intensity, large bandwidth peak had many submodes with strong polarization and angular dependence. In a series of designed experiments the intensity and central wavelength of these submodes were varied with geometrical alterations of the photonic crystal, and theoretically were correlated to surface plasmon resonances. A computer model was developed that matched experimental data. Results imply optimization of photonic crystal structure in Phase II could isolate a single sub-mode resulting in very low dispersion, very low divergence emission that could be coherent. The project will support high-end computational research at a university for complex electro-magnetic modeling of photon - surface plasmon interactions. Improved structures predicted by these calculations will be fabricated at an NSF supported nano-fabrication facility. We will examine effects of altered symmetry, periodic defects, and detailed shaping of electrostatic fields.  All existing choices for coherent radiation in the mid-infrared spectral region are too expensive for widespread vapor detection. Examples are wavelength shifting of high power pulsed lasers using non-linear optical effects or quantum cascade lasers (now $5,000 each). The proposed source could sell for less than $10.  Additionally, it could significantly reduce the cost of sensitive spectroscopic instrumentation allowing detection of vapors well below 1ppm concentration and application to widespread use as toxic vapor detectors for commercial, residential, and homeland defense applications. Compared to other technology, these detectors are temperature insensitive, rugged, and free of interference effects with zero maintenance and zero drift.

Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials are used to reduce weight without compromising the strength of structural components, but because they are built layer by layer, they have certain weaknesses. This project will advance a new approach to to enable production of higher performance automobiles, airplanes, turbines and more. The process can be highly automated, cost-effective, and seamlessly integrated with existing CFRP manufacturing. This can be integrated into existing processes. The continued development of stronger and lighter composite parts will also have an impact in related fields including renewable energy resources. The technology holds the promise of reducing operating costs, improving fuel efficiency, and decreasing emissions. This will lead to significant impacts on national security in advanced manufacturing. The strong technical innovation in the project is identifying the use of electrospinning to coat a prepreg CFRP roll with carbon nanotube (CNT)/epoxy nanofilaments that can form a CNT-reinforced bonding surface that is square meters in area and just tens of microns in thickness. This project will address the longstanding weak through-thickness interlaminar strength of CFRP prepreg laminates using a low materials-cost and highly automated process. The project will expand on the primary innovation to develop a theoretical understanding of multiscale nanoscaffold-enhanced CFRP advanced composites through genetic algorithm assisted machine learning (GAML) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The objective is to establish an experimentally and computationally supported GAML framework for determining optimal processing parameters and structural features.

In African Americans, the prevalence is andgt;11%. A majority of asthma sufferers are sensitized to allergens, including those shed in the feces, saliva, and exuviae of cockroaches. Thus, exposure to cockroach infestation is recognized as both a significant risk factor for the development of allergic asthma and a potent trigger of asthma attacks. The asthma risk from cockroach exposure is particularly high in inner-city residences where elevated levels of cockroach allergens are common. For example, some studies have shown that cockroach allergens are found at high concentrations associated with asthma in andgt;45% of high-rise apartments in the U.S., and andgt;60% of asthmatic children in U.S. inner cities are sensitized to cockroach allergens. Treating active cockroach infestations can significantly reduce allergen levels within structures and is one strategy to improve asthma symptoms that is recommended by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Board. The German cockroach, Blatella germanica, is the most widespread and problematic cockroach pest in urban environments. The use of insecticidal baits has traditionally been the most effective method for control of this species. However, the spread of insecticide resistance across populations of B. germanica can reduce the efficacy of insecticidal interventions, creating a need for improved tools. Our research team recently reported that the gut microbiota contributes to insecticide resistance in B. germanica. We also found that disrupting the gut microbiota decreases reproductive fitness. Accordingly, we predict that targeting the microbiota of German cockroaches by incorporating antibacterial metal oxide nanoparticles into insecticidal bait formulations could be an effective strategy to improve control of insecticide-resistant infestations in the field. We propose three specific aims to test the viability of this approach against cockroaches resistant to diverse insecticides using two types of metal oxide nanoparticles with known antibacterial properties (ZnO and CuO). In aim 1, we will determine if antibacterial nanoparticles can increase the efficacy of several commonly used bait insecticides against resistant cockroach strains. In aim 2, we will determine if antibacterial nanoparticles in bait can adversely affect cockroach life history. In aim 3, we will determine if nanoparticle-insecticide combination baits can eliminate resistant cockroach populations under semi-field conditions. It is expected that the results of our work will inform the development of novel insecticidal bait formulations to mitigate insecticide resistance and improve cockroach control, which has been demonstrated to reduce asthma morbidity and improve outcomes in human populations.STATEMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE There is a clear relationship between exposure to cockroach allergens and allergic asthma morbidity in both children and adults. Prior studies have established that interventions to reduce cockroach allergen levels, particularly insecticidal treatments that decrease cockroach populations, can significantly reduce morbidity and improve outcomes in asthma sufferers. Results from our work will enhance the efficacy of insecticidal formulations for more efficient control of cockroach infestations, thereby directly reducing cockroach- associated health risks and improving environmental hygiene in human homes.",DANGSHENG LIANG,,(408) 969-0088,dliang@apexbait.com,JOSE PIETRI,,(605) 658-6391,jepietri@ucdavis.edu,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA,,,"['exposure cockroach', 'significant risk factor', 'asthma attack', 'asthma risk', 'exposure', 'inner-city residence', 'study', 'high-rise apartment', 'inner city', 'active cockroach', 'level', 'structure strategy', 'National Asthma Education Prevention Board', 'urban environment', 'method control', 'insecticide resistance', 'tool', 'research team', 'report', 'insecticide resistance', 'reproductive fitness', 'target microbiota', 'antibacterial', 'nanoparticle', 'metal oxide', 'nanoparticle', 'antibacterial property', 'zno cuo )', 'antibacterial nanoparticle', 'strain', 'antibacterial', 'life history', 'nanoparticle-insecticide', 'semi-field condition', 'development', 'mitigate', 'insecticide resistance', 'control', 'outcome', 'statement', 'relationship', 'exposure', 'child', 'study', 'level', 'treatment', 'outcome asthma sufferer', 'health risk', 'environmental hygiene', 'human home']"

Health risks are significant for these professions with high rates of heart disease, obesity, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) over the age of 40 have a higher risk of a coronary event compared to the national average, and their average life expectancy is 21 years less than the U.S. average. LEOs experience higher rates of depression (12.0% vs. 6.8%) and PTSD (15-18% vs. 7-8%) than the general U.S. population. Suicidal ideation and attempts are significantly higher for LEOs, with protective service workers having a suicide rate 3.5 times higher than national norms. While job experiences of military police, firefighters, and emergency medical staff can vary widely from their civilian counterparts, there is no reason to believe military first responders can escape the negative health risks of their profession (including a PTSD incident rate of 11-20% for veterans as a whole). With these concerns, there is an increasing focus on finding ways to prevent and mitigate the impact of stress and trauma on first responders through resilience-building initiatives. However, stigma around acknowledging and seeking help for such concerns is as serious an obstacle in civilian first responder communities as it is in the military. One strategy TIAG has explored to off-set this issue is through the use of technology. Recommendations from a 2019 report by the Police Executive Research Forum on reducing suicide recommended agencies offer “confidential, easy-to-access tools (including online tools) for officers to assess their well-being and obtain referrals for assistance”. Online and mobile technologies can be accessed privately and confidentially and can help reduce stigma attached to using behavioral health and resilience-based resources. In studies with U.S. military members, up to a third of soldiers who would otherwise not seek help endorsed a willingness to use technology to access mental health resources. Mobile technology has the potential to put self-help resources in users’ “back pocket” – readily available, easily accessible and private.  The mResilience training and mRes mobile application developed by TIAG provides reliable, confidential, and secure access to evidence-based tools with the goal of promoting individual psychological resilience. For instance, when an individual needs support, the peer-support and resources modules allow them to confidentially access assistance to help address their concerns without fear of negative personal or job impacts.

This can be done by using high-temperature superconductors, allowing for much larger temperature margins, a higher magnet performance and less mechanical degradation during operation.  There are currently no feasible methods to construct HTS cables that have the performance and current homogeneity needed for fusion magnets.  Advanced Conductor Technologies will develop high-temperature superconducting `Conductor-on-Round-Core cables, invented by the Principal Investigator, for use in fusion magnets.  These cables will have a homogenous current distribution at high current ramp rates, a stable operation at elevated temperatures and high magnetic fields, and will be mechanically robust.  During Phase I we have demonstrated the feasibility of Conductor-on-RoundCore cables for fusion applications. Weve shown, both analytically and experimentally, that the current distribution in these cables remains homogeneous at current ramp rates as high as 68,000 amperes per second.  We also developed a cable with a record current carrying performance of 5,021 amperes in a background field of 19 teslas.  During Phase II we propose to construct a six-aroundone cable, capable of carrying a current of over 60,000 A, by bundling six Conductor-on-RoundCore cables around a central cooling tube.  The cable will be optimized to withstand the large forces during operation and to allow for operation at elevated temperatures.  We will test the cable in flowing helium gas and at magnetic fields as high as 12 teslas.

Insulin-like growth factor-I has been implicated in the initiation of the proliferative phase of atherosclerotic lesion development but inhibiting IGF-I receptor activity may lead to toxicity. IGF-I functions cooperatively with the ?V?3 integrin to stimulate smooth muscle division and migration which are related to the development of atherosclerosis. The purpose of these studies will be to determine if targeting the ?V?3 integrin disrupts IGF-I stimulated atherosclerotic lesion progression in pigs with diabetes. A secondary purpose will be to humanize the available mouse monoclonal antibody so that it can be administered safely to patients without inducing an immunogenic response. The current monoclonal antibody directed against the cysteine loop (amino acids 177-183 of the ? subunit of the ?V?3 integrin) will be converted to a Fab2 fragment and purified. This Fab2 fragment will then be administered to pigs with diabetes for three months to determine if it inhibits the progressive enlargement of atherosclerotic lesions. Control pigs will receive an irrelevant antibody. At the end of the treatment period, the carotid, femoral and coronary arteries will be analyzed to determine if antibody has inhibited the rate of atherosclerotic lesion progression. Additionally ultrasound of the femoral arteries will be used to determine if the antibody can induce lesion regression. Tissues will be removed and analyzed biochemically to determine that ?V?3 activation by the hyperglycemic stimulus has been inhibited and that IGF-I signaling is inhibited. Tissues will also be tested to determine whether autoimmunization has occurred. In a second part of the study a humanized antibody will be prepared using the complementarity determining regions of the mouse antibody. These regions will grafted onto human framework sequences that are obtained from library of known human sequences. The sequence will then be scanned for regions of potential immunogenicity and peptides prepared and tested directly to determine if they have T-cell reactive epitopes. If immunogenic regions are present they will be modified by mutagenesis and tested to determine if immunogenicity has been removed. Further assessment of the 3 dimensional structure of the antibody will be undertaken to determine those residues that are within 10 angstroms of the CDR antigen binding site. These residues will also be modified to reduce their interaction with the binding domain. The final substituted humanized antibody will then be prepared using PCR and the full length gene product expressed. The purified product will then be tested for its ability to inhibit IGF-I stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and clones will be analyzed to select those with the highest levels of expression that can be used in GMP manufacturing. The long term objective will be to prepare large scale quantities of the antibody for administration to human subjects. The treatment goal would be to administer to diabetic patients with atherosclerosis who have wide spread disease that is not amenable to current therapies. Since atherosclerosis is the cause of death in 80% of diabetes and there is no currently available therapy that specifically treats this problem, there is a major need for new therapies that are directed toward treatment of this complication. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has very high relevance to public health. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes. It also leads to disability due to heart attacks, strokes and amputations. This project is seeking to develop a drug that will specifically inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes and that has the potential to prevent these complications.",DAVID CLEMMONS,,(919) 966-4735,,DAVID CLEMMONS,,() -,,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'long term', 'study', 'atherosclerosis', 'insulin-like growth factor-i', 'initiation proliferative phase', 'receptor activity', 'function', 'development', 'atherosclerosis', 'target', 'mouse', 'immunogenic response', 'amino acid 177', 'antibody', 'end treatment period', 'femoral coronary artery', 'antibody', 'ultrasound femoral artery', 'antibody', 'lesion regression', 'tissue', 'signaling', 'tissue test', 'humanized antibody', 'mouse antibody', 'framework sequence', 'library', 'human sequence', 'sequence scan region', 'immunogenicity peptide prepare test', 't-cell', 'mutagenesis test', 'assessment', 'dimensional', 'structure antibody', 'residue', 'angstrom cdr antigen binding site', 'residue', 'interaction', 'binding domain', 'humanized antibody', 'pcr length gene product', 'product test', 'smooth muscle cell', 'level', 'expression', 'gmp manufacturing', 'long term', 'antibody', 'human subject', 'treatment goal administer', 'diabetic', 'spread disease', 'current therapy', 'atherosclerosis', 'death', 'therapy', 'problem', 'therapy', 'public health', 'public health', 'atherosclerosis', 'death', 'patient diabete', 'lead disability heart attack', 'drug', 'atherosclerosis', 'potential']"

Our business objectives are: 1) to become the established leader in guidance and monitoring software systems, and 2) to be acquired by a company whose capital and resources can deve lop SymTrend software for its maximum benefit and profit potential. Healthcare Implications. SymTrend systems address and overcome a major obstacle to effective interventions in special education and community medicine: the lack of information tools for: 1 ) symptom recording, 2) progress monitoring, 3) intervention evaluation, 4) trigger detection, 5) behavioral guidance, and 6) care coordination. Research Design. Our research design incorporates a guidance and monitoring curriculum that involves handheld c omputer use by students and teachers/coaches. Data is collected daily by students and teachers via handheld computers in individualized diaries and is HotSync'd to a web site, where it is graphed as progress charts. The curriculum content includes interven tions for social pragmatics, feelings awareness and management, and personal activity management appropriate for AS/HFA teens. This curriculum will be tested in schools where these students are in inclusion classrooms. We will contrast outcomes in their in tervention classes with generalization classes and with the behavior of wait-list controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE SymTrend guidance and monitoring systems can address and overcome a major obstacle to effective interventions in special education and commu nity based medicine. That obstacle is the lack of information tools for: 1) symptom recording, 2) progress monitoring, 3) intervention evaluation, 4) symptom trigger detection, 5) behavioral guidance, and 6) care coordination. To date SymTrend support tool s have been used in the education and treatment of individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including: Autism, Aspergers Syndrome, Traumatic Brain Injury, Stroke, Depression with self injurious behavior, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder and Schizo phrenia.", ,,(617) 484-7510,mlevine@symtrend.com, ,,() -,,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'Hill test portable Visual Guidance system', 'internet', 'asperger syndrome', 'autism', 'school', 'social pragmatic', 'management', 'assignment management', 'monitoring', 'feedback', 'datum collection', 'goal setting', 'problem detection', 'intervention evaluation', 'guidance monitoring system software autism applica', 'neuropsychiatric healthcare', 'theoretical rationale special education', 'person', 'system', 'social pragmatic self-management skill', 'inclusion environment', 'intervention framework', 'healthcare', 'monitoring', 'software system', 'company capital resource deve lop symtrend software', 'healthcare', 'special education', 'information tool', 'symptom recording', 'monitoring', 'evaluation', 'trigger', 'detection', 'care coordination', 'research design', 'research design', 'monitoring', 'student teachers/coache', 'student teacher handheld computer', 'web site', 'graph progress chart', 'content', 'social pragmatic', 'awareness', 'management', 'personal activity', 'curriculum test', 'school student', 'contrast outcome', 'class behavior', 'wait-list control', 'public health', 'SymTrend guidance monitoring system', 'special education', 'information tool', 'symptom recording', 'monitoring', 'evaluation', 'symptom trigger', 'detection', 'care coordination', 'SymTrend support tool', 'education treatment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'autism', 'asperger syndrome', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'injurious behavior', 'bipolar disorder']"

The microdevice printer developed by Auma Laboratories, LLC is based on two-photon direct-writing. The Auma Printer diverges from current (non-commercial) direct-writing machines because it is designed to pattern bio-specific materials from PDMS over areas up to 1000 mm2, depths up to 10mm, and translate at many tens of centimeters/second. This size and rate is required by the biosensor community where microfabrication on petri-dishes, slides, inside microfluidic channels, etc. with submicron resolution is desired. The structures generated by this technique are tunable polymeric solids, made by scanning a focal volume through an optically addressable monomer precursor. The technique is used to achieve better than 50 nanometers volumetric resolution, and is capable of realizing 3D, functionalized polymeric solids in a single processing step.  Aside from the profoundly unique applications of Two-Photon Direct-Writing (sub-surface and single-step three-dimensional patterning of sensor materials), there is also great potential to flat-out replace far costlier, time consuming, and chemically toxic technologies currently used in polymer microdevice fabrication. However, the list of compatible materials is currently devoid of any PDMS systems. PDMS material has become popular for microfluidic applications during the last decade because of its numerous advantages over silicon and glass. PDMS is inexpensive, is optically transparent down to 230 nm, has very low fluorescence, is gas permeable, and is water impermeable (for cell culturing). By coupling novel two-photon initiators to PDMS systems, this work will have tremendous impact throughout the biological/chemical sensor and medical microdevice manufacturing communities.",Aaron Young,PhD,(206) 491-1738,cody@aumalabs.com,Aaron Young,PhD,(206) 491-1738,cody@aumalabs.com,,,,"['Small Business Innovation', 'Research phase', 'commercialization 3d microdevice printer biosensing', 'application development', 'microdevice printer', 'size', 'rate', 'biosensor', 'community microfabrication', 'microfluidic channel', 'submicron resolution desire', 'structure', 'technique', 'polymeric solid', 'scan focal volume', 'technique', 'resolution', 'polymeric solid single processing', 'application', 'three-dimensional', 'potential', 'material', 'pdms system', 'pdms material', 'microfluidic', 'low', 'fluorescence', 'gas permeable', 'water impermeable', 'cell culturing', 'two-photon initiator pdms system', 'impact', 'biological/chemical sensor']"

However, the current high-precision measurement technologies are better suited for detecting gases with low concentration, and a new technology needs to be developed for major components to measure gas concentration with a high precision in a response time <100 ms.  General statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. To solve the problem, this proposal calls for developing a new mass-spectrometry-based concentration measurement technology for atmospheric gases using a miniature array of quadrupole mass filters and a capillary tube, which will allow fast, portable, and accurate detection of high concentration atmospheric gases. Ambient gases passing through the capillary channels are ionized, filtered, and detected using mass spectroscopy techniques. This technology can measure multiple gas components virtually in real time, therefore allowing fast detection of the ratio between the target gases.  What is to be done in Phase I? The work will include a demonstration of the feasibility of portable gas analysis technology that can measure concentration rapidly and reliably. The atmospheric concentration ratio of greenhouse gas components (carbon dioxide and water vapor) to argon and nitrogen will be measured to demonstrate the measurement accuracy of the device. Key components of the Phase II prototype, such as ionization source and quadrupole electrodes, will be designed and/or fabricated.  Commercial applications and other benefits. Portable mass spectrometers can detect a small or large amount of target elements based on their chemical composition and mass. Due to the universal nature of the technology (i.e., detecting elements from mass), these devices can be used for various government and industrial chemical tracing/detection applications. A portable technology allowing continuous monitoring of environmental gases will be of great importance, as an increasing number of applications require instantaneous diagnosis and situation awareness. For example, the proposed technology may replace military and police K-9 teams, offering cost-effective and flexible solutions for gas tracing. Gas monitoring is widely used in industrial process monitoring, for example in the semiconductor or pharmaceutical industries. Widespread adoption of these ultrasensitive mass spectrometer devices has been limited by their size, weight, and price.

They are rugged and reliable and can be left in the field for a long period of time after deployment.  To improve the spatial resolution for separating multiple closely spaced targets that move in tight formations while reducing the on-board computational requirements,  a modest quantity of single microphones could be deployed in a surveillance area of interest.  These microphones are considerably less expensive, small sized and contain generic DSP boards capable of performing simple detection, feature extraction and data compression tasks. They are also equipped with basic communication systems to transmit essential compressed target information to a master station which has more sophisticated computational power to carry out high-level operations for sensor array processing and target detection, tracking, and classification.

The extracted subband features would allow for detection and preliminary classification of the targets in time-frequency as well as data compression and encoding.   In this framework, only essential frequency and tonal target features that are needed for accurate target localization and classification will be encoded and transmitted, thus yielding a low bit rate without incurring degradation in the overall detection, tracking and classification performance.

Once the validation is complete, the company positioned to quickly make the product available to the marketplace.  Drug metabolite profiling using primary human hepatocytes has gained more importance in the past decade as it has become recognized that drug metabolism is closely related to drug safety.

Additionally, there is a strong movement in the US as well as in Europe to reduce animal trials and develop improved in vitro technologies.

Vecna will address this challenging problem by investigating and developing four key desirable characteristics of such systems: that they be declarative, generative, self-aware, and prescient. Declarative means that behavior is defined by declarative constraints, rather than by procedural code. Generative means that the system is built from separately validated components that interact within an inferencing environment to produce behavior. Self-aware means that the system is aware of its own internal state, including the functional status of its components. Prescient means that the system is able to predict the chances of success of a particular course of action. These characteristics, combined, have the potential to dramatically improve V &amp; V for complex autonomous systems. Vecna will leverage significant, recent advances in the field of model-based autonomy to develop prototypes of systems with these characteristics. In order to ground the analysis, Vecna will use its own robotic systems, QCBot and RPR, as testbeds for evaluating the technology. QCBot is a hospital delivery robot, and RPR is used in warehouse logistics applications.  BENEFIT:  The technology proposed is useful to a  broad range of  government and commercial applications consisting of extensively networked automated systems comprised of many interconnected discrete deployments of software and hardware. Using this technology, customers will be able to monitor automated system components and diagnose component faults and failures, test systems for proper behaviors, upgrade individual components and verify uninterrupted performance, and  optimize system parameters.  For commercial markets, clear applications include: power grids and energy delivery infrastructure; cooperative teams of robots in healthcare and logistics;&quot;smart&quot;buildings with automated climate and electrical system control; and public infrastructure like sewage/water treatment and traffic control systems.

The same work has shown that many kilobits of data can be spectrally multiplexed within single spatial storage locations. These factors, taken together, open the door to an entirely new class of optical data storage, i.e., read/write Optical Random Access Memory (ORAM). ORAM is expected to provide 10-100 Gigabyte single-unit storage capacities, data transfer rates in the Gigabit/sec range, and achieve microsecond-scale random access latency through entirely non-mechanical operation. As the name implies, ORAM resembles semi-conductor memory in terms of its speed. However, ORAM resembles magnetic disk memory in terms of single-unit capacity. ORAM provides a unique joining of the attributes normally associated with semiconductor and magnetic disk storage, and, at the Gigabyte capacity levels of interest, ORAM should be at a distinct cost advantage relative to semiconductor RAM. ORAM offers the potential for development to speeds even beyond those afforded by semiconductor devices. Furthermore, the optical foundation of ORAM allows for the incorporation of holographic parallelism in later evolution of the technology.

This platform will generate a formulation containing high concentrations of protein therapeutics which may be delivered at substantially lowered viscosities due to a reduction in the intermolecular interactions among proteins. The formulation thus provides a subcutaneous syringe-compatible route to delivering biologics at high-concentration, and low-viscosity, ultimately driving a shift from timely intravenous delivery protocols to simplified subcutaneous injections. Constraints on subcutaneous delivery volume (<2 mL) necessitate antibody concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL. Unfortunately, viscosities far beyond the accepted injection limit (50 cP) are typical of this situation due to extensive interaction among the protein molecules. Current viscosity reduction methods attempt to regulate these interactions but have yet to substantially address the issue. The proposed work utilizes a novel process to gently formulate proteins using only FDA-approved materials. This approach eliminates the effect of the protein-protein interactions on the solution viscosity. The proposed project will involve development of the platform through (i) identification of optimal formulation parameters, (ii) demonstration of rheological improvements to high-concentration protein solutions, and (iii) demonstration of preservation of biological structure and activity.",Paul Brown,,(727) 455-8147,paul@elektrofi.com,Paul Brown,,(727) 455-8147,paul@elektrofi.com,,,,"['fast delivery protein', 'high-concentration', 'low-viscosity solution', 'subcutaneous injection', 'high-concentration antibody solution', 'viscosity', 'high-concentration', 'short administration time drug', 'solution', 'therapy', 'frequency', 'injection', 'development', 'technology', 'development', 'intractable solution', 'patent life', 'goal phase', 'viscosity', 'reduction', 'intermolecular interaction protein', 'high-concentration', 'low-viscosity', 'intravenous delivery', 'subcutaneous injection', 'subcutaneous delivery volume', 'antibody', 'viscosity', 'injection limit', 'interaction', 'viscosity reduction', 'interaction', 'issue', 'process', 'effect', 'protein-protein interaction solution', 'viscosity', 'development', 'identification', 'high-concentration protein solution', 'biological structure']"

In addition, the lower radiation dose required (compared to electron microscopy) allows tomographic investigation of subcellular structures in three dimensions. Existing synchrotron based microscopes have shown the potential of the soft x-ray microscope as a research tool, but they have the disadvantage of being tied to a massive light source at only a few national laboratories. A suitably bright, compact, low cost light source is the enabling innovation needed to realize a commercial biological soft x-ray microscope. In a Phase I NIH SBIR program (2R44RR022488-02) Energetiq demonstrated a unique, compact light source that generates the required x-ray wavelength and intensity for imaging. In the following Phase II NIH SBIR program (5R44RR022488-03) Energetiq constructed a  proof-of-principal  microscope. With three months left to go in the Phase II program, nearly all major program goals have been met, and we are on track to completing the rest of the program goals on schedule and within budget. In the proposed Phase II Renewal program, Energetiq will focus on significantly shortening exposure time through increasing the source brightness and will work with an existing manufacturer (Xradia, Inc.) of x-ray microscopes to integrate the Energetiq source with their microscope, thus accelerating the point at which a commercial instrument will be available in the market. The ultimate goal will be a new commercial tool for researchers to use in studying subcellular structures.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologists have a need to image whole biological cells at high resolution and in their hydrated state. Currently available commercial, integrated microscopes satisfy one of these requirements but not both. Soft x-ray microscopy in the so-called 'water window' allows resolution to 20nm for fully hydrated cell samples, and can produce 2-D and 3-D tomographic images. The ability to resolve subcellular structures in hydrated cells, and to create those images in minutes rather than days, could lead to more rapid advances in drug discovery, disease diagnosis, disease treatment and in the understanding of fundamental cellular processes. The proposed program will enable the widespread adoption of this technique by researchers.",STEPHEN HORNE,,(781) 939-0763,,STEPHEN HORNE,,(781) 939-0763,SHORNE@ENERGETIQ.COM,,,,"['DESCRIPTION', 'applicant', 'soft x-ray microscopy', 'technique', 'image', 'cellular structure resolution', 'optical microscope', 'electron microscopy', 'low radiation dose', 'electron microscopy', 'tomographic', 'subcellular structure', 'soft x-ray microscope', 'disadvantage tie massive', 'compact', 'cost light', 'biological soft x-ray microscope', 'compact light source', 'x-ray wavelength intensity imaging', 'proof-of-principal   microscope', 'program', 'goal', 'schedule', 'phase', 'renewal program', 'Energetiq focus', 'exposure time', 'source brightness', 'Energetiq source microscope', 'market', 'subcellular structure', 'public', 'health', 'image', 'biological cell', 'hydrated state', 'integrated microscope', 'soft x-ray microscopy', 'water window', 'resolution', 'tomographic image', 'subcellular structure hydrated cell', 'image', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease treatment', 'cellular process', 'program', 'adoption technique']"

Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care.

There are an estimated 1.5 million of cases annually in the US with 250,000 resulting in death. The number of cases and associated deaths is expected to increase given the rising at-risk population of elderly individuals and the compounding challenge of antibiotic resistance. Treatment of sepsis involves antimicrobial therapy in addition to several supportive care measures to address the complications of the systemic inflammatory response. In order to effectively and appropriately address the pathophysiological aspects of sepsis, a treatment must provide antimicrobial activity in addition to immunomodulatory properties. It is imperative that efforts to identify new and effective treatment strategies for sepsis shift from the traditional antibiotic development programs that focus solely on antimicrobial activity and turn toward strategies that address both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory aspects of the disease.Arrevus is developing a novel approach to addressing sepsis using Designer Proline-rich Antimicrobial peptide Chaperone protein inhibitors (DPCs), derived from insects and selectively modified, acting as inhibitors to one of the critical bacterial proteins responsible for bacterial protein folding, DnaK. As an adjuvant therapy to current antibiotics, DPCs have the potential to provide a much-improved treatment option for multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. Preliminary studies have displayed the potential of ARV-1502, the lead DPC, as an effective antimicrobial agent against MDR bacterial pathogens in addition to providing immunomodulatory effects. Specifically, our efforts have shown that: 1) DPCs show efficacy against MDR pathogens (both gram-negative and gram-positive) alone and in combination with traditional antibiotics; 2) DPCs offer a novel and specific bacterial target; 3) ARV-1502 has demonstrated immunomodulatory properties; and 4) ARV-1502 exhibits a favorable safety profile. Collectively, these data support the continued development of ARV-1502 through an STTR Phase I program targeting proof-of-concept data for the use of ARV-1502 in the treatment of sepsis.In this Phase I proposal, we will build upon significant preliminary data to demonstrate proof-of-concept for the use of ARV-1502 for treating sepsis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effect of ARV- 1502 treatment on host innate and adaptive immunity using peripheral blood monocytes and T-cells from sepsis patients. In Aim 2, we will assess the in vivo efficacy of ARV-1502 in murine sepsis models to improve survival (in aim 2A using a near-lethal sepsis model) and host protective immunity (in aim 2B using a survivable murine sepsis model in which animals survive the initial infection but are immunosuppressed). The overall goal of this Phase I program is to generate initial proof-of-concept data and to assess when and how ARV-1502 would be best utilized in sepsis.Project Narrative Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory syndrome that is initiated by the presence of an infection and is associated with high mortality. Current therapeutic options do not properly address antibiotic-resistant pathogens and the host inflammatory response. Arrevus is developing a new class of antimicrobial peptides derived from insects that act via a novel mode of action with both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities to serve as an effective treatment for sepsis.",CARL KRAUS,,(919) 366-5501,ckraus@arrevus.com,CARL KRAUS,,(919) 366-5501,ckraus@arrevus.com,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,,,"['life-threatening syndrome', 'death', 'at-risk', 'elderly', 'antibiotic resistance', 'treatment sepsis', 'antimicrobial therapy', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'treatment', 'antimicrobial activity', 'immunomodulatory property', 'treatment strategy', 'antibiotic development', 'program', 'antimicrobial activity', 'immunomodulatory aspect', 'dpc', 'critical bacterial protein', 'adjuvant therapy', 'dpc', 'potential', 'much-improved treatment', 'multi-drug resistant ( mdr )', 'preliminary study', 'lead dpc', 'antimicrobial agent', 'mdr bacterial', 'immunomodulatory effect', 'mdr pathogen', 'target', 'immunomodulatory property', 'safety profile', 'development', 'sttr phase', 'target', 'proof-of-concept datum', 'treatment sepsis', 'phase proposal', 'effect', 'treatment', 'host', 'adaptive immunity', 'peripheral blood monocyte t-cell sepsis', 'near-lethal sepsis model', 'host', 'protective immunity', 'animal', 'goal phase', 'proof-of-concept datum', 'systemic inflammatory syndrome', 'pathogen', 'host', 'inflammatory response', 'mode action', 'immunomodulatory activity', 'treatment sepsis']"

Further, laboratory simulation enables highly classified signal emissions to be contained, which is not possible while radiating on the range.  Unfortunately, today's laboratory simulators cannot reproduce the requisite signal environments with sufficient fidelity in order to permit SEI signal generation for receiver development, test and library reprogramming.

Despite significant progress in the development of in vitro CTC-detection assays, they still have low sensitivity due to the small samples of blood taken. To overcome these problems, we developed in vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) and demonstrated its feasibility in pilot trials with melanoma patients where we used melanin in CTCs as an intrinsic PA contrast agent. These trials identified the key limitations of the PAFC platform, such as a stationary laboratory setup with a large expensive laser, a motion- and skin-pigmentation-sensitive recording system, no spectral identification of melanoma CTCs in the blood background, a detection limit 20–30-fold lower than the ultimate threshold, and limited clinical data. These obstacles prevent the routine use of this promising technology. The goal of our Phase I STTR proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility and clinical relevance of an advanced PAFC-based “Cytophone” prototype for early, fast (from 20 sec to a few min), noninvasive (no blood draw), label-free (no exogenous contrast agents), and safe (no skin photodamage or blood contamination concern) detection of CTCs in melanoma patients. To achieve this goal, we will optimize the Cytophone’s parameters and eventually explore its clinical capabilities during testing of melanoma patients. We expect to obtain statistically significant data that will demonstrate an unprecedented 1000-fold increase in sensitivity, allowing us to detect 1 CTC in 1 liter of blood with our robust, wearable, and portable Cytophone device. This level of sensitivity will allow us to detect CTCs released from small tumors (e.g., ≤ 1 mm), which are often not identified with current diagnostic techniques. The goal of our Phase II STTR proposal is to develop commercial Cytophone prototypes to be tested in multicenter clinical trials. We expect that the Cytophone can eventually be used in melanoma-focused clinics throughout the world for early diagnosis, monitoring treatment efficiency, and as a mass melanoma screening tool (as the mammogram is used for breast cancer).PROJECT NARRATIVE In many cases, melanoma—an aggressive malignancy reaching epidemic proportions—is diagnosed only after becoming untreatable. The goal of this proposal is to establish a new approach for early melanoma diagnosis by examining circulating tumor cells in the entire blood volume with an unprecedented 1000-fold increase in sensitivity. This will be accomplished with a robust, easy-to-use, portable, and wearable device called the Cytophone.

Device specifications are isolation better than 20 dB and on-chip optical loss less than 6 dB. The isolator device will be combined with a laser and integrated optic modulator to demonstrate the isolator in an RF over fiber transmitter application. Heterogeneous integrated RF over fiber components on aerial platforms are of particular interest due to the potential benefits of high performance, improved reliability, increased EMI immunity, and reduction of weight and cost. The compact integrated optical isolator is seen as a key technology to achieve these benefits.",Sri Sriram,,(614) 799-0664,sri@srico.com,Vincent Stenger,Principal Research Engineer,(614) 799-0664,sri@srico.com,,,,"['magneto-optic', 'material processing', 'fabrication technique', 'integration optical isolator', 'optic isolator base film', 'potential', 'compact relative base material', 'magnetic field', 'proposal', 'isolator device', 'prototyped test', 'device', 'photonic substrate', 'device specification', 'isolation', 'on-chip optical loss 6 db.', 'isolator device combine', 'optic modulator', 'isolator rf fiber', 'transmitter', 'rf fiber component', 'performance', 'reliability', 'reduction', 'cost', 'compact integrated optical isolator key']"

These patterned coatings are expected to reduce unnecessary energy consumption caused by film-wise condensation mechanisms, typical in modern condenser systems. Instead, the proposed surfaces promote sustained drop-wise condensation, a mechanism that is, according to theory, 10 times more energy efficient than film-wise condensation, thus leading to significant reductions in material and operating costs. State-of-the art commercial coatings that promote drop-wise condensation have limited operating lifetimes of only 100 h. Therefore, a durable coating that facilitates sustained operation for longer durations is highly desirable for commercial applications. The technology proposed in this grant application involves the manufacture of surfaces with patterned hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions through the deposition of a hydrophobic coating that can be thermally decomposed locally via a carbon dioxide laser affording spatial resolutions below 100 micrometers. The methods selected to manufacture, apply, and pattern the coatings are standard industrial large-scale processes and are amenable to scaling up. The patterned wettability coatings are anticipated to improve the energy efficiency of condensation surfaces by a factor of 2 - 4 times from the current state-of-the-art. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects a number of large market segments that depend on condensation processes, from small household dehumidifiers and HVAC systems, to large scale desalination plants. Condensation is an extremely energy intensive process. Thus, any costeffective performance enhancement facilitates numerous applications, such as enhanced dehumidification, HVAC and atmospheric water generation. The dehumidifier market alone represents a global market of $7 billion. By incorporating NBD coatings into existing commercial units, energy costs may be reduced without compromising condensation output, thereby disrupting the market with new energy efficient devices. The proposed technology also has civilian, humanitarian and military applications because it recovers water from the natural humidity in the atmosphere in virtually any region of the world. It will enable the US to increase its national security by enabling efficient water harvesting, lend goodwill through support of humanitarian needs, improve our nation&#039;s economic competiveness, and ultimately bring more STEM jobs to America. Enhanced condensation can have a significant logistical impact for any remote operation worldwide where water is not readily accessible. Other uses can enable increased global sustainability for capturing potable water for human, animal and plant consumption.",Joanna Wong,,(339) 224-0850,joanna@nbdnano.com,Joanna Wong,,(339) 224-0850,joanna@nbdnano.com,University of Illinois,,,"['Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'phase project', 'water condensation', 'heat transfer', 'surface', 'coating', 'patterned coating', 'energy consumption', 'film-wise condensation mechanism', 'modern condenser system', 'surface', 'mechanism', 'time energy', 'film-wise condensation', 'lead significant', 'reduction material', 'cost', 'coating', 'drop-wise condensation limit', 'coating', 'operation', 'technology', 'grant application', 'manufacture', 'surface pattern', 'deposition', 'coating', 'locally carbon dioxide', 'spatial resolution', 'micrometer', 'method', 'manufacture', 'pattern coating standard', 'large-scale process', 'coating', 'energy efficiency', 'time current', 'state-of-the-art', 'condensation process', 'hvac system', 'performance', 'enhancement', 'application', 'atmospheric water', 'market', 'global market', 'coating', 'energy cost', 'compromise condensation output', 'market', 'energy efficient', 'device', 'military application', 'water', 'water harvesting', 'goodwill support', 'economic', 'STEM', 'condensation significant', 'logistical impact', 'remote', 'water', 'global sustainability', 'animal']"

The problems associated with communication during a catastrophic event are well documented. One area of particular concern is the unreliability of PSRN. Generally speaking the PSRN performance is worst when the system is needed most; in the early stages of a disaster response. For example, the 9-11 Commission Recommendation Card released on Sept. 1, 2011, specifically identified the PSRN for first responders as a major weakness in disaster preparedness. Further, the simple allocation of additional spectrum in public safety radio bands will not fully address the problem. Taking into account the unique restrictions attached to PSRN, this project will provide leap-ahead improvement in efficiency of wireless communication bandwidth by minimizing the harmful effects of interference and allowing graceful degradation of wireless systems. The program will utilize recently developed RF interference cancellation technologies and apply them to commercial wireless communication applications. Further new resource allocation algorithms will be developed. The initial focus will be on public safety radio networks, but can be applied a wide range of wireless systems. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to address the demand for RF bandwidth which has been growing exponentially. This demand is driven by almost unlimited consumer demand for wireless communication services. Though broadband wireless access networks appear to be ubiquitous, we are rapidly running out of bandwidth as the radio spectrum becomes more crowded. By 2015, the demand for data traffic is expected to increase by over 3000%, according to Bernstein Research. To accommodate such an increase in usage, cell towers are being located closer together, thus increasing their interference. In addition, the Federal Communication Commission regulates bandwidth usage with a very static allocation approach. As a result, large amounts of spectrum are underutilized while other parts of the spectrum are saturated, creating unnecessary bottlenecks. The proposed program will demonstrate technology that will substantially improve the efficiency of spectrum usage.",Andrew McCandless,,(225) 802-7131,mccandless@bascomhunter.com,Andrew McCandless,,(225) 802-7131,mccandless@bascomhunter.com,Stub,,,"['Small Business Innovation Research Program', 'phase project', 'public safety', 'radio network', 'problem', 'document', 'performance', 'system', 'disaster response', 'Commission recommendation Card', 'spectrum public', 'radio band', 'problem', 'efficiency', 'communication', 'bandwidth', 'harmful effect', 'degradation', 'program', 'rf interference cancellation technology', 'communication', 'application', 'resource allocation', 'focus public safety', 'radio network', 'wireless system', 'rf bandwidth', 'consumer', 'network', 'demand datum', 'traffic', 'cell tower', 'interference', 'Federal Communication Commission', 'static allocation approach', 'program', 'technology', 'efficiency']"

The Elmer middleware layer, along with the Elmer Software Developer's Kit, will enable third-party developers to easily add communications capabilities to their educational applications, such that their applications are independent of the platform (e.g., PalmOS, PocketPC, Cell Phone) on which their applications are running.  Thus, in a classroom, each student can be working in the same application, e.g., concept mapping, sharing information on their handheld and collaborating synchronously, all the while working on different handheld (or even desktop/laptop) computers.

A scalable and sustainable production process for natural melanins is needed to support the R&D and commercialization of melanin-based technologies. MelaTech proposes to develop a fermentation system that involves a novel, rapid melanin isolation process to yield gram quantities of natural melanin from fungi. This process was originally developed by the Casadevall group at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The Casadevall group and collaborators have additionally demonstrated that fungal melanin is effective in shielding against ionizing radiation and capture heat from the entire solar irradiance.

Conventional HPM lenses are usually machined from a dense material exhibiting thedesired electrical characteristics, such as polyethylene, and are inherently heavy.  Heavy lenses are undesirable for handheld, mobile, aircraft, and especially spacecraft applications.There is an alternative approach to source lens design.  Lightweight artificial dielectrics can be constructed of a composite material.  One element of the composite is a low loss background (or substrate) dielectric and the other is an additive consistingof metallic particles, metallic flakes, or conducting spheres.  The additive acts to increase the dielectric constant of the substrate material and a wide range of values are theoretically possible.  Additionally, if the substrate is made of plastic,manufacturing of components can be greatly simplified by using injection molding techniques and the weight can be significantly reduced by introducing voids into the material.

Together, each technology enables maximum performance in HQ's two regimes of flight: the electric system is responsible for lift while hovering (high power, short endurance), and the gas engine gives long endurance in fixed wing flight (low power, long endurance). Latitude proposes to address NOAA's requirement for a ship based UAS capable of carrying a 15lb payload and operating from ships, or confined land areas, by combining the lessons learned fron the development of the HQ-40 and HQ-90 aircraft. The resulting HQ-55 aircraft will have a higher useful load fraction than any previous HQ aircraft design, while staying under the 55lb limit to allow operations under the new Part 107 regulations. Phase I provide the feasibility of the HQ-55 by creating an initial design and a prototype airframe, which was successfully flown. Phase II will see the refinement and “productionization” of the airframe, the integration of NOAA’s aerosol sampling payload and flight tests conducted from a NOAA ship at sea.SUMMARY OF ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The outcome of the proposed project will be a high performance VTOL UAS capable of carrying a specified 15lb aerosol sampling payload while operating from a ship. The goal is to provide 10 hours of endurance and maintain flexibility for additional payload integrations.

Such information would allow citizens to take preventive measures to reduce their exposures to air toxics, which would impact their health and quality of life tremendously. Mobile devices such as smart-phones and tablets represent a powerful infrastructure that could be leveraged to develop personal air monitors. However, traditional sensor technologies (e.g., electrochemical and photo-ionization detectors) commonly used for industrial safety monitoring, are big, power-hungry, and have limited sensitivity and lifetime.N5 Sensors, Inc. will demonstrate highly-selective sensor architecture, utilizing nanoengineered gallium nitride (GaN) photoconductors functionalized with multicomponent nanoclusters of metal-oxides and metals. Innovation in photoenabled sensing enables these sensors to operate at room-temperature, resulting in a significant reduction in operating power. The strength of N5 Sensors’ technology is that it uses all standard microfabrication techniques, which promises economical, multianalyte, single-chip sensor solution. Due to the use of inert wide-bandgap semiconductor, metal-oxides and noble metals, the environmental impact of the sensors during their life cycles is minimal.   By combining the “designer&#039;” adsorption properties of multicomponent nanoclusters together with sensitive transduction capability of nanostructured GaN backbones, N5 Sensors will demonstrate sensors for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene—commonly referred to as BTEX. Feasibility of this approach will be demonstrated by designing sensors and testing their sensitivity to such chemicals with detection range from 500 ppt to 1 percent, with minimal cross-sensitivity to various components of environmental matrix, namely particulate matter, reactive gases and non-target gases. Sub-micron structures will be formed on GaN epitaxial thin-films on sapphire using lithography and plasma etching. Such structures will be functionalized with multicomponent nanoclusters of metal­oxides and metals using reactive-sputter deposition. The Phase 1 effort will demonstrate BTEX sensors, consuming&lt;1 mW of power and through detailed testing establish their operation reliability, measurement accuracy and calibration needs. Innovative sensor designs and measurement protocols will be evaluated for increased reliability and accuracy. Completion of Phase 2 will result in an array of nanoengineered sensors on a single chip, each tailored to sense specific air toxics: BTEX, Ox, SOx, CO2, and O3.Future prospects of such low-power, small form-factor sensors include embedded-chip or plug-in module with multi­analyte sensor arrays for the smart phones for citizens and soldiers for acquiring real-time environmental information.

This effort will include the assembly of electrically interconnected layers to produce a compact and computationally efficient Alternate Architecture implementation featuring three-dimensional stacking of ICs directly below a 2-dimensional detector array.  Massively parallel operation is realized by integrating sensing and processing functions at the pixel level thereby relieving the severe data bottleneck found in conventional architectures attempting to satisfy large focal plane formats and emerging weapons system requirements.   Present architectures multiplex the tens of thousands to millions of individual pixel signals into very few high-speed video lines prior to complex signal processing occurring after digitization.  For example, typical infrared sensor formats now in production have output data rates around 6 MHz (60-Hz frame-rates).   The next generation of multicolor arrays requires data rates reaching well into the gigahertz.  Compact, low-power systems, especially requiring high dynamic range and high frame-rates, simply cannot handle the vast volume of raw data.

Treatment systems are now being held accountable for providing evidence-based treatments (EBTs). As a result, thereis increasing pressure on counselors to adopt and implement empirically-supported treatments such as motivational enhancement, cognitive behavioral treatment, and twelve-step facilitation. Current efforts rely primarily on downloads, online courses, and training announcements - all of which are static methods. These methods are not tailored to counselors&#039; educational needs or client caseloads. We are therefore proposing the development of Behavioral Health Solutions, which will provide tailored, real-time,evidence- based treatment recommendations to substance abuse counselors. These recommendations will be based on core elements of EBTs and provide step-by-step EBT delivery directions, instructional videos, and handouts for clients. The goal of this product is to increase the understanding and effective use of evidence-based practices so that counselors can more flexibly use these practices with their substance-abusing clients. Behavioral Health Solutions will be available on mobile devices, allowing counselors to easily access important interventions that are relevant to current client needs. This innovative product represents a major advancement over current training methods, which are asynchronous with treatment delivery, cumbersome, and often too costlyto use in day-to-day clinical work. Other advantages of this product include: (1) training that occurs in proximity to treatment, thereby increasing the potential for implementation; (2) content that is linked to pertinent client resources; (3) standard content review and updates (via Hazelden&#039;s large editorial operation); (4) content that is easily tagged and pushed, and (5) the ability to track counselor implementation of EBTs. This Phase II embodies a collaboration between two organizations with extensive experience in the addictions and behavioral health fields. Hazelden Publishing (Center City, MN) is a leader in providing evidence-based programs for the full continuum of care, ranging from prevention and intervention to treatment and recovery management. Inflexxion (Newton, MA) has conducted interactive health research in the addictions for the past 17 years. The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate that Behavioral Health Solutions will significantly improve counselor EBT implementation. The field test will examine the primary hypotheses that, relative to a control condition (treatment as usual with access to online EBT materials), counselors assigned to the Experimental group will evidence significantly greater: (1) EBT self-efficacy, (2) positive attitudes about the use of EBTs, and (3) self- reported use of EBTs.

An electron cooling system, to be built as part of a planned luminosity upgrade, will have parameters and requirements fundamentally different from any built previously, and there is a need for high-speed, high-fidelity numerical simulations to assess the impact of space-charge, nonlinearities, and machine errors on the electron transport line.  There exists already a parallel 3-D code that includes the effects of space-charge and magnet nonlinearities.  We will add needed functionality to this code to make it a suitable tool for doing high-fidelity simulations and analysis of high-current magnetized electron transport lines, including misalignments and nonlinear rf accelerating fields.  We developed and implemented methods to extract from electric field data the information required to construct high-order maps for rf cavities.  We have defined an approach for adding general misalignments to a high-order beam dynamics code.  And we have applied this code to tracking simulations of an electron transport line that is currently under research and development. We will complete the implementation of accurate, high-order maps for RF cavities, and implement general misalignments.  In collaboration with scientists at government labs, we will use the improved code to make detailed studies of a novel electron transport line currently under design.  We will also develop a suite of tools---input file converters, post-processing utilities, and the like---that will make it easier for scientists to compare with simulations done by different codes.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The proposed code will benefit scientists working to design accelerators in which space-charge, field nonlinearities, and machine errors are significant concerns.

(KBSI) proposes to design and demonstrate a simulation-based training framework to improve RPA-operator airspace situation awareness.  A key innovation is the use of simulation-based training methods to increase and maintain airspace situation awareness with manned and RPA systems.  The resulting&quot;Framework for Airspace Situation-awareness Training (FAST)&quot;will provide automation support for multiple functions including (i) creation of instructionally sound scenario-based training content for airspace management and de-confliction for systems that include manned and RPA systems; (ii) authoring and adaptively evolving scenarios that improve the effectiveness of simulation-based training for airspace situation awareness with manned and RPA systems; (iii) measuring airspace management and de-confliction performance; and (iv) delivering high fidelity immersive training for enhanced airspace situation awareness with manned and RPA systems.    Building off the results of the successful Phase I project, KBSI&quot;s proposed Phase II effort will (i) establish FAST Phase II application requirements, (ii) design  FAST scenario content, performance measurement, and adaptive scenario generation, (iii) demonstrate a focused, field-able, and scalable simulation-based training application of the FAST technology.    BENEFIT:  The main benefits of the proposed research include the following:  (i) significant improvement in the quality of training for airspace management, situation awareness, communications, and control for both manned and RPA systems; (ii) significant decrease in the time and cost to create and maintain instructionally valid simulation-based training content; and (iii) reduced cost to build and deploy simulation-based training for both manned and RPA systems.

Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) allows extraction of harder-to-reach geothermal energy by actively pumping cold fluids into hot basement rock. DOE and industry seek to improve geothermal well completion, stimulation, and/or operations via improved understanding and prevention of wellbore impairment. IFOS proposes an innovative, photonic-computation-based wellbore integrity and SHM system, WellSense™, for real-time wellbore health monitoring and prognostics. The system will leverage an integrated distributed fiber optic sensing system that integrates multifunctional and multiplexable Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors with Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) for high-precision strain, pressure, and temperature measurements. The multifunctional WellSense™ system will relate multi-parameter, multi-point direct measurements made with fiber-optic sensors to wellbore conditions in real-time. The fiber optic cable will be suitably ruggedized for installation in high temperature and pressure environments, thereby rendering it capable to operate in harsh regimes (up to 200&#176;C and 5,000 PSI). In addition to IFOS’ on-the-fly, light-speed optical computation performed in the fiber sensing layer, the on-board analytics will leverage a ‘Digital Twin’ system that integrates geophysical, mechanical, and chemical models of the test specimen with numerical modeling and AI- enhanced edge computing. The ‘Digital Twin’ framework will integrate virtual representations of wellbore components and surface production systems behavior with models of reservoir flow to map calculated temperature, pressure, acoustic waveforms, and energy flow parameters to specific impairment and failure signatures and mechanisms. This will allow the on-board diagnostics and prognostics architecture to optimize the trade-off between failure probability and production to manage remedial actions. In Phase I the IFOS multidisciplinary team will demonstrate the feasibility of its fracture characterization system. In Phase II, the team will perform field validation of an integrated engineering prototype. The borewell characterization provided by IFOS’ photonic system will increase the energy efficiency of EGS production by giving operators greater understanding of the structural health of the well.",Sargis Babakhanian,,(408) 565-9001,sb@ifos.com,Richard Black,,(408) 565-9000,rjb@ifos.com,,,,"['energy generation', 'doe industry', 'stimulation', 'operation', 'photonic-computation-based wellbore', 'integrity', 'SHM system', 'real-time wellbore health monitoring', 'system', 'optic sensing system', 'temperature sensing', 'high-precision strain', 'pressure', 'temperature', 'measurement', 'multifunctional WellSense ™ system', 'multi-parameter', 'multi-point direct measurement', 'fiber-optic', 'real-time', 'fiber optic cable suitably ruggedize', 'ifos ’ on-the-fly', 'light-speed optical computation', 'fiber sensing layer', 'Digital Twin ’ system', 'mechanical', 'chemical model test', 'enhance', 'edge', 'computing', 'Digital Twin ’ framework', 'virtual representation', 'system behavior', 'reservoir flow map', 'temperature', 'pressure', 'energy flow', 'mechanism', 'prognostic architecture', 'probability', 'production', 'phase ifos multidisciplinary team', 'phase', 'field validation', 'prototype', 'ifos ’ photonic system', 'energy efficiency', 'egs production', 'structural health']"

All other natural disasters (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, etc) account for only a small percentage of those injured in fire every year and it is estimated that as many as 200,000-300,000 are actually injured in fire but the majority are not reported. Fire is the 5th leading cause of accidental death behind only motor vehicle accidents, falls, poisonings, and drowning deaths. In addition fire causes over $9 billion in direct damage and in excess of $100 billion in total damages. A significant decrease in both injuries and the monetary loss from fire has occurred over the past twenty years and this is credited in large part to the widespread use of smoke detectors. Smoke detectors and smoke alarm systems not only provide a means of reducing death and injury, but also allow for a quicker response to the fire, resulting in less damage. The goal of this research project is to develop a portable, inexpensive device for use by the hearing impaired community (approximate 22 million in the United States [Adams]) that identifies the audio signal from a smoke detector, a fire alarm horn or other emergency notification audio signal and then activates an alert mechanism capable of waking a deaf individual in all stages of sleep. The aim is for the devices signal recognition capabilities of the device to provide equal protection to this disabled population as that provided to the hearing able population as dictated in the National Fire Protection Association 72, National Fire Alarm Code. These concepts will be investigated in two distinct paths. The first path will further refine the auditory recognition capabilities of a signal identification algorithm developed in Phase I research to include nonperiodic smoke detectors and emergency alarm horns. The second path of this research involves testing deaf, hearing-impaired and hearing able individuals for their response to alert mechanisms. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of audible smoke detectors in waking hearing able individuals and use this information as a base line for deaf individuals response to tactile or visual waking devices. No research could be identified in the literature that links sleep stage monitoring and effectiveness of waking of emergency alarms.
