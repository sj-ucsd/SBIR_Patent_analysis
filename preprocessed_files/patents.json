electrical power line, a support frame selectively releasably attached to the UAV, and a plurality of flexible dielectric support lines attaching the power line tool to the support frame. Each of the support lines are attached to a corresponding attachment point on the support frame and a corresponding attachment point on the power line tool.\n","1":"\nThe disclosure relates generally to a method of changing an optical state of an electrochromic device. The method may include: selecting a desired optical state of the electrochromic device; determining a driving power to change the optical state based on an initial state and the desired state of the electrochromic device. The driving power comprises a first magnitude and a second magnitude, and the first magnitude is larger than the second magnitude.
