Production of a high efficiency arthropod repellent by chemically transforming a substance used by mosquitoes as an attractant, the lactic acid, as well as lactates, in this case (S)-ethyl lactate, which is an essential attractant for A. aegypti females. The hydroxyl functional group of lactic acid must be transformed into esters, and the carboxylic acid functional group into amides, since esters and amides are functional groups already present in other repellents, such as in the structure of DEET, IR 3535 and dimethyl phthalate. The ester functional group of (S)-ethyl lactate must undergo a reaction in which the acyl functional group is substituted by an amine of interest and the hydroxyl functional group must be acylated. The structure of an attractant, or a derivative thereof, is transformed into a high efficiency repellent.

The circular 9 mm wide hole is elevated to a height of and a Flow Diverting Cap removable secured is placed on top of the elevated hole. The Flow Diverting Cap is 16.6 mm wide circular metal flat top cap with a spring loaded circular eight-legged 7.7 mm long Fixing Clip that allows hot air to be easily diverted through the eight 2.8 mm wide slit openings located in between each spring-loaded clip leg. Each clip leg is 2.5 mm wide, arranged around the circumference of the bottom of the circular flat top and are extending down to a length of 7.7 mm. The extract is placed inside the 27 mm wide Glass Bowl inside wall and the outside wall of the 11 mm elevated circular 9 mm wide hole. You place the Volcano Extract Bowl inside the Volcano Chamber Housing and place the Volcano Chamber Housing with the Volcano Extract Bowl inside, on top of the Storz & Beckel Volcano Vaporizer heating core. When the (446 F) degree air pushes out of the Volcano Vaporizer heating core and through the elevated hole, it gets diverted by the Flow Diverting Cap causing maximum turbulence and heat exchange. Due to this process the inside of the Volcano Vaporizer Chamber Housing heats up to (446 F) and simultaneously heats up the Volcano Extract Bowl and the extract in it to the same degree, causing the extract to vaporiie. The vaporized extract vapers get pushed out of the Volcano Vaporizers Chamber Housing Exhaust.

Heat obviously rises and having the burn box offset from the hopper is going to use less coal. It will use less coal both when in operation and also once it's been turned off (closing both dampers). The reason it uses less coal is because the slide and hopper are not vertically above the burn box and thus receive less heat.

Embodiments of the invention are directed towards systems, methods and computer program products for providing improved eye tests. Such tests improve upon current eye tests, such as visual field tests, by incorporating virtual reality, software mediated guidance to the patient or practitioner such that more accurate results of the eye tests are obtained. Furthermore, through the use of one or more trained machine learning or predictive analytic systems, multiple signals obtained from sensors of a testing apparatus are evaluated to ensure that the eye test results are less error-prone and provide a more consistent evaluation of a user's vision status. As it will be appreciated, such error reduction and user guidance systems represent technological improvements in eye tests and utilize non-routine and non-conventional approaches to the improvement and reliability of eye tests.

Systems and methods are disclosed to objectively identify sub-second behavioral modules in the three-dimensional (3D) video data that represents the motion of a subject.

The present invention relates to the field of ultrasounds and imagining of the coronary blood flow of the heart.

A tilted needle biopsy assembly is provided for mounting on an x-ray system. Because the biopsy needle is angled relative to at least one of the detector and the x-ray source, x-ray imaging may be performed during the biopsy procedure without interference by the biopsy device. The angled biopsy needle additionally allows improved access to the axilla and chest wall of the patient. The stereotactic biopsy device of the present invention may be coupled to any x-ray system, whether upright or prone, including but not limited to mammography systems, tomosynthesis systems, and combination mammography/tomosynthesis systems. The system flexibly supports the use of any mode of image capture (i.e., scout, two dimensional mammogram, three-dimensional reconstructed volume) for either or both target visualization and target localization. With such an arrangement, a needle biopsy assembly having improved patient coverage is provided for use with a variety of different x-ray imaging platforms.

Chronic venous insufficiency is an advanced form of venous disease affecting more than 2.5 million patients in the United States of whom approximately 500,000 have venous leg ulcers. [1-3] A majority of these patients have an obstruction in the deep veins of the pelvis either alone or with venous valve reflux that leads to the development of chronic venous insufficiency. Such obstruction often extends for varying lengths above the groin, at times all the way up to the right atrial chamber of the heart. Pathology of such obstruction could be narrowing of the aforementioned veins or could be a complete blockage (occlusion). Such treatment involves use of stent to open up the obstruction going from an area of good venous blood inflow to an area of good venous blood outflow.

The present invention is directed to methods for the treatment of gefitinib and/or erlotinib resistant cancer. An individual with cancer is monitored for cancer progression following treatment with gefitinib and/or erlotinib. Progression of the cancer is indicative that the cancer is resistant to gefitinib and/ or erlotinib. Once progression of cancer is noted, the subject is administered a pharmaceutical composition comprising an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. In preferred embodiments, the irreversible EGFR inhibitor is EKB-569, HKI-272 and HKI-357.

The present invention relates to the use of organic and highly water-soluble compatible solutes or a solute mixture, preferably in the form of an inhalable, oropharyngeally, nasally and intravenously administrable composition, in the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by ss(+)RNA viruses of the Coronavriridae family, preferably of those diseases caused by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and/or HCoV-229E. Particularly suitable solutes in the meaning of the invention are ectoine and its derivatives, Glycoin, mannosylglycerate (Firoin) and mannosylglyceramide (Firoin-A), which, due to their strong water-binding capacity, reduce the binding of the viruses to the receptors of the host cell in the transitional epithelium, e.g. eye, in the internal epithelium, e.g. lung, and in the endothelium and thus reduce or prevent the multiplication of the viruses. According to the invention, prevention is enabled by a reduced infectious sputum and breath, and treatment and rehabilitation of the affected tissues is enabled by the membrane protective properties of the compatible solutes according to the invention.

Viral epidemic infections due to influenza, or coronaviruses, particularly influenza A and SARS-CoV-1 and -2 virus cause significant morbidity and mortality. The significant mutation rate of this group of viruses renders existing vaccines or antiviral drugs often useless, creating a need for broad acting, viral DNA or RNA sequence independent antiviral drugs. This invention describes the repurposing of methylene blue and riboflavin, two FDA approved drugs with an excellent safety profile. Using a virus neutralization assay of H1N1 Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, the significant viricidal activity of both drugs at pharmacological dose and under physiological conditions is demonstrated. In vivo prophylactic and therapeutic use of the drugs for anti-viral application in an animal model is described.

The invention is based on the discovery that rho kinase inhibitors can be used to treat proteinopathy associated wandering. A number of degenerative neurological diseases are thought to be caused, at least in part, by the formation of protein aggregates that cause neurotoxicity and progressive decline in function.
