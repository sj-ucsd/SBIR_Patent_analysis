JULY 2023 IEEE Thesaurus

The IEEE Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary
of almost 11,570 descriptive engineering,
technical and scientific terms, as well as IEEEspecific society terms [referred to as
“descriptors” or “preferred terms”] .* Each
descriptor included in the thesaurus represents
a single concept or unit of thought. The
descriptors are considered the preferred terms
for use in describing IEEE content. The scope of
descriptors is based on the material presented in
IEEE journals, conference papers, standards,
and/or IEEE organizational material. A controlled
vocabulary is a specific terminology used in a
consistent and controlled fashion that results in
better information searching and retrieval.
Thesaurus construction is based on the
ANSI/NISO Z39.4-2021, Critera for Indexes.
Thesaurus vocabulary uses American-based
spellings with cross references to British variant
spellings. The scope and structure of the IEEE
Thesaurus reflects the engineering and scientific
disciplines that comprise the Societies, Councils,
and Communities of the IEEE in addition to the
technologies IEEE serves.
IEEE has developed its controlled vocabulary
through consultation with subject matter experts
(specialists in a particular field) and specialists in
information analysis. The IEEE Thesaurus thus
provides a controlled vocabulary of subject
headings to help people categorize or search for
engineering and computing concepts, especially
IEEE published content.

The IEEE Thesaurus also provides a conceptual
map through the use of semantic relationships
such as broader terms (BT), narrower terms
(NT), 'used for' relationships (USE/UF), and
related terms (RT). These semantic
relationships identify theoretical connections
between terms. Italic text denotes Non-preferred
terms. Bold text is used for preferred
headings.

Abbreviations used in the Thesaurus:
BT - Broader term
NT - Narrower term
RT - Related term
USE- Use preferred term
UF - Used for

*Refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.4-2021 Criteria for
Indexes, Sections 5 through 8 for detailed
information on controlled vocabularies, display
formats, usage and spelling, and selection
criteria for descriptors
(http://www.niso.org/publications/z394-2021indexes).
