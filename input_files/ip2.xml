<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A row unit (10) of an agricultural planter with an apparatus for adjusting the depth of a trench opened by the row unit (<b>10</b>). The row unit (<b>10</b>) includes a trench depth adjustment assembly (<b>90</b>T) configured to modify the trench depth. The trench depth adjustment assembly (<b>90</b>T) includes a depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>) pivotally connected via a pivot to a frame member (<b>14</b>) of the row unit (<b>10</b>). An electric motor (<b>5030</b>) is operable to cause rotation of a shaft (<b>5038</b>) operably coupled with the depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>), whereby rotation of the shaft (<b>5038</b>) causes the depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>) to pivotally move about the pivot (<b>92</b>) thereby changing a position of contact of the depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>) with a gauge wheel arm (<b>54</b>), thus changing the amount of upward ravel of the gauge wheel (<b>52</b>) with respect to a trench opening disc (<b>62</b>) and thus the depth of the trench.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In recent years, farmers have recognized the need to select and maintain the proper planting depth to ensure the proper seed environment (e.g., temperature and moisture) and seedling emergence. To improve agronomic practices, it would also be desirable for the farmer to understand the relationship between actual planting depth and metrics such as emergence and yield. Conventional agricultural planters include only apparatus for adjusting a maximum planting depth, which may not be maintained during operation due to soil conditions or insufficient down-pressure on the planter row unit. Even in operation of modern planters having sensors for determining whether full trench depth has been lost, the actual depth planted is still not determined. Thus there is a need for systems, methods and apparatus for controlling and/or measuring the depth of a trench opened by an agricultural planter.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an agricultural implement, e.g., a planter, comprising a toolbar <b>8</b> to which multiple row units <b>10</b> are mounted in transversely spaced relation. Each row unit <b>10</b> is preferably mounted to the toolbar by a parallel arm arrangement <b>16</b> such that the row unit is permitted to translate vertically with respect to the toolbar. A downforce actuator <b>18</b> may be mounted to the toolbar <b>8</b> and the parallel arm arrangement <b>16</b> and configured to apply supplemental down-pressure to the row unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The row unit <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>14</b> which supports an opening disc assembly <b>60</b>. The opening assembly <b>60</b> may include two angled opening discs <b>62</b> rollingly mounted to a downwardly extending shank <b>15</b> of the frame <b>14</b>. The opening discs <b>62</b> open a v-shaped trench <b>3</b> (i.e., furrow, seed furrow) in the soil surface <b>7</b> as the row unit <b>10</b> advances in a forward direction of travel through the field. The row unit <b>10</b> includes a gauge wheel assembly <b>50</b> which may comprise two gauge wheels <b>52</b> pivotally mounted to either side of the frame <b>14</b> by two gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>. The gauge wheels <b>52</b> roll along the surface of the soil. A depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b> pivotally mounted to the frame <b>14</b> at a pivot <b>92</b> contacts the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> to limit the upward travel of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>, thus limiting the depth of the trench opened by the opening disc assembly <b>60</b>. A closing assembly <b>40</b> is preferably pivotally coupled to the frame <b>14</b> and configured to move soil back into the trench <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, seeds <b>5</b> are communicated from a hopper <b>12</b> to a seed meter <b>30</b> configured to singulate the supplied seeds. The meter <b>30</b> may be a vacuum-type meter such as that disclosed in Applicant's International Patent Pub. No. WO/2012/129442, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In operation, the seed meter <b>30</b> preferably deposits the supplied seeds into a seed tube <b>32</b> which may be removably mounted to the frame <b>14</b>. In operation, seeds <b>5</b> deposited by the meter <b>30</b> fall through the seed tube <b>32</b> into the trench <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b> is illustrated in more detail. The depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b> includes a rocker <b>95</b> pivotally mounted to a depth adjustment body <b>94</b>. The depth adjustment body <b>94</b> is pivotally mounted to the row unit frame <b>14</b> about the pivot <b>92</b>. A handle <b>98</b> is slidably received within the depth adjustment body <b>94</b> such that the user can selectively engage and disengage the handle (e.g., left and right hooks <b>99</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>99</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, which may be formed as a part of the handle <b>98</b>) with one of a plurality of depth adjustment slots <b>97</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) formed within the row unit frame <b>14</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the handle <b>98</b> is partially slidingly received within a cavity <b>710</b> of the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, and an optional spring <b>730</b> engages an annular lip <b>740</b> disposed on the bottom end of the handle <b>98</b>. The spring <b>730</b> imposes a resilient force to retain the hooks <b>99</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) in the selected slot <b>97</b>, but permits the user to withdraw the handle <b>98</b> to temporarily disengage the hooks <b>99</b> from the slot <b>97</b>. In operation, the upward travel of the gauge wheels <b>52</b> is limited by contact of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> with the rocker <b>95</b>. When one of the gauge wheels, e.g., left gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, encounters an obstruction, the rocker <b>95</b> allows the left gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to travel upward while lowering the right gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> by the same absolute displacement such that the row unit <b>10</b> rises by half the height of the obstruction. It should be appreciated that there are other row units with manual adjustments similar to those described herein. Non-limiting examples can be found in U.S. Publication Nos. US20170000003 and US20170006757, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The depth adjustment assemblies described herein work with similar systems with rockers, pivot, and adjustment arms.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be appreciated that the handle <b>98</b> and depth adjustment body <b>94</b> comprise a primary depth adjustment sub-assembly configured to permit the user to select one of a plurality of pre-selected furrow depths. The pre-selected furrow depths each correspond to one of the depth adjustment slots <b>97</b>. In some embodiments, as described in detail later, rather than using the handle <b>98</b> to manually select a depth adjustment slot, an actuator may be used to adjust the position of handle <b>98</b>; for example, a linear actuator (not shown) mounted to the row unit frame <b>14</b> may be disposed to adjust the position of the handle <b>98</b>. Alternatively, a rotary actuator may turn a gear which adjusts the position of the handle relative to the depth adjustment slots <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In each of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>A and <b>12</b></figref>, a secondary depth adjustment assembly is configured to modify one or more of the pre-selected furrow depths. The secondary depth adjustment assembly may modify the pre-selected furrow depths by more precise adjustments (e.g., by smaller adjustment steps) than the depth modifications enabled by the primary depth adjustment assembly (e.g., by selecting which depth adjustment slot <b>97</b> is engaged by the handle <b>98</b>). For example, referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>A includes an actuator <b>720</b> which adjusts the effective length of the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>A. In the illustrated embodiment, the extension of actuator <b>720</b> determines the position of the rocker <b>95</b> relative to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>. As illustrated, the rocker <b>95</b> is pivotally mounted to a movable member <b>770</b> having a cavity <b>775</b> for receiving a protrusion <b>760</b> mounted to (or formed as a part with) the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>. The protrusion <b>760</b> and cavity <b>775</b> retain the alignment of the moveable member relative to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, but permit the actuator <b>720</b> to modify the position along an axis which is parallel to the pivot axis of the rocker <b>95</b>. It should be appreciated that modification of the extension of actuator <b>720</b> (and thus the effective length of the depth adjustment assembly) modifies the furrow depth for any given depth setting of the handle <b>98</b>. Any of the secondary depth adjustment assemblies described herein may be used as the only depth adjustment, such that the primary depth adjustment does not need to be set, and whereby the secondary depth adjustment can adjust the depth adjustment body <b>94</b> across the entire range of depth settings.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>B having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein an actuator <b>800</b> modifies the angular position at which one or more gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> is stopped by the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>B for any given setting of the depth adjustment handle <b>98</b>. The actuator <b>800</b> adjusts a position of a surface <b>810</b> which is pivotally mounted to the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>; the surface <b>810</b> is disposed to contact the rocker <b>95</b> at the point of maximum upward travel of the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>. Extension of the actuator <b>800</b> and thus modification of the position of surface <b>810</b> thus modifies the point of maximum upward travel of the gauge wheel and thus modifies the furrow depth determined by the gauge wheel. In some embodiments, a functionally similar actuator <b>800</b> and pivotally-mounted surface <b>810</b> may be mounted to both gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>C having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein a modified rocker <b>900</b> is configured to modify its shape in order to modify the furrow depth for any given depth setting of the handle <b>98</b>. The rocker <b>900</b> includes portions <b>910</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>910</b>-<b>2</b> which contact the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>54</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, to limit the upward travel of the gauge wheel arms. An actuator <b>950</b> changes the angle between the portions <b>910</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>910</b>-<b>2</b> and thus the shape of the rocker <b>900</b>. Retraction of the actuator <b>950</b> raises the members <b>910</b> and thus modifies the maximum height of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> and the furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>D having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein the rocker <b>95</b> is pivotally mounted to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, preferably about a laterally extending axis defined by pivot <b>1010</b>. An actuator <b>1000</b> preferably determines the angular position of the rocker <b>95</b> about the pivot <b>1010</b> relative to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, thus modifying the maximum upward travel of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> and the furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> illustrates an alternative to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In this embodiment, pivot <b>1010</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is removed, and rocker <b>95</b> is attached to connector <b>1011</b>, which pivots about pivot <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>E having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein an actuator <b>1230</b> advances a depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> (e.g., a wedge) which is slidingly fixed to the gauge wheel arm and disposed to slide along the length of the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>. An actuator <b>1230</b> (e.g., a linear actuator such as an electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuator) selectively modifies (e.g., by extension or retraction) the position of the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b>, e.g., along the length of the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>. The position of the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> along the length of the gauge wheel arm modifies the uppermost angular position of the gauge wheel arm relative to the rocker <b>95</b> and thus modifies the depth of the furrow opened by the row unit in operation. The actuator <b>1230</b> may be mounted to the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>, e.g., by being fixed to a plate <b>1225</b> mounted to the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the actuator <b>1230</b> may adjust the position of the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> by means of a biasing mechanism. The biasing mechanism may increase or reduces a biasing force on the wedge <b>1210</b> as the actuator <b>1230</b> is extended. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the actuator <b>1230</b> may modify a position of a biasing member such as a plate <b>1220</b> relative to the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b>. Optionally, a first spring <b>1215</b><i>a </i>is may be fixed to the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> at a first end thereof and may be fixed to the plate <b>1220</b> at a second end thereof. Optionally, a second spring <b>1215</b><i>b </i>may be fixed to the plate <b>1220</b> at a first end thereof and may be fixed to the plate <b>1225</b> at a second end thereof. In the undeflected position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, neither of the springs <b>1215</b><i>a, </i><b>1215</b><i>b </i>impose a substantial force on the biasing member <b>1210</b>. As the actuator <b>1230</b> advances from the undeflected position, the spring imposes an increasing advancing force on the biasing member <b>1220</b> (e.g., generally toward the rocker <b>95</b>). As the actuator <b>1230</b> retracts from the undeflected position, the spring imposes an increasing retracting force on the biasing member <b>1220</b> (e.g., generally away from the rocker <b>95</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In operation, when a component of force transmitted from the actuator <b>1230</b> (e.g., via the spring <b>1215</b><i>a </i>of the biasing mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) to the rocker <b>95</b> exceeds an oppositely acting force of the rocker <b>95</b> on the gauge wheel arm (or on the depth adjustment member if the rocker is already contacting the depth adjustment member), the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> advances, forcing the rocker <b>95</b> farther away from the gauge wheel arm and reducing the furrow depth. It should be appreciated that the biasing force may be built up gradually by extension of the actuator <b>1230</b> without being sufficient to advance the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> until sufficient extension of the actuator or until reduction of downforce.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one method of calibrating the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P, the actuator <b>2050</b> is &#x201c;homed&#x201d; or &#x201c;zeroed&#x201d; with respect to a starting position. The zero or home position may be associated with the shallowest setting, with the deepest setting, with the shallowest and the deepest setting, or with a known depth between the shallowest and deepest settings, such as, for example, a two inch depth.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">By way of example, to zero or home the actuator <b>2050</b> to the shallowest depth, the motor <b>2030</b> is commanded to actuate via the planter monitor <b>50</b> to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> along the gear rack <b>2010</b> toward the shallowest position until the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> abuts with a positive stop on the gear rack <b>1910</b>. When the positive stop is reached, the current detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b> will begin to spike, indicating the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is at the shallowest setting possible, which establishes the zero or home position. The detected current spike associated with the zero or home position may be between 5% to 20% of the full motor current. For example, if the motor <b>2030</b> is an 18 amp motor, when the current reaches 2 amps (i.e., approximately 10% of the full motor current), the motor is commanded to shut off, and that position is associated with the &#x201c;zero&#x201d; or &#x201c;home&#x201d; position. In other words the motor may be commanded to shut off before the current reaches full current to save the motor from being overworked. In other embodiments, the current spike may be no more than 95% of the full motor current, or no more than 90%, or no more than 80%, or no more than 70%, or no more than 60%, or no more than 50%, or no more than 40%, or no more than 30%, or no more than 25% of the full motor current.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Once home or zero is established, a block of a known thickness (e.g., two inches) is placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> to simulate a known trench depth setting (i.e., the permitted travel distance of the gauge wheels with respect to the opener disks). The motor <b>2030</b> is then commanded to actuate to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> toward the deepest trench depth setting until another spike in the current is detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, indicating that the gauge wheels are pressing firmly against the blocks and establishing that the predefined trench depth setting has been reached (e.g., the two inch depth corresponding to the block thickness). As the depth adjustment moves from the shallowest position until reaching the predefined block depth setting, the number of revolutions of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b> are counted via the Hall effect sensor detecting the rotation of the magnet <b>2010</b> (which rotates with the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>). The counted number of revolutions, whether of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>, are hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;revolution counts.&#x201d; The number of revolution counts will therefore correspond to the predefined depth setting (which, in this example, is a two inch depth based on the known thickness of the block placed under the gauge wheels). Therefore after calibrating to a known block thickness, the relationship (linear or non-linear depending on the shape of the row unit <b>10</b>) between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with respect to the gear rack <b>1910</b> based on revolution counts.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">It should also be appreciated that rather than zeroing or homing the actuator to the shallowest depth, the actuator may be zeroed or homed to the deepest depth. In such a method, the motor <b>2030</b> is commanded to actuate via the planter monitor <b>50</b> to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> along the gear rack <b>2010</b> toward the deepest position until the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> abuts with a positive stop on the gear rack <b>1910</b>. When the positive stop is reached, the current detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b> will begin to spike, indicating the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is at the deepest setting possible, which establishes the zero or home position. Once zero or home is determined, a block of a known thickness (e.g., two inches) is placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> to simulate a known trench depth setting (i.e., the permitted travel distance of the gauge wheels with respect to the opener disks). A benefit to going to the deepest setting possible is that the weight of the planter is carried by opening discs <b>62</b> on each row unit <b>10</b> so that the planter does not need to be raised. This allows the block to be placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>. The motor <b>2030</b> is then commanded to actuate to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> toward the shallowest trench depth setting until another spike in the current is detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, indicating that the gauge wheels are pressing firmly against the blocks indicating that the predefined trench depth setting has been reached (e.g., the two inch depth corresponding to the block thickness). As the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> moves from the deepest position until reaching the predefined block depth setting, the number of revolutions of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b> are counted via the Hall effect sensor detecting the rotation of the magnet <b>2010</b> (which rotates with the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>). The number of revolution counts will therefore correspond to the predefined depth setting (which, in this example, is a two inch depth based on the known thickness of the block placed under the gauge wheels). Therefore, after calibrating to a known block thickness, the relationship (linear or non-linear depending on the shape of the row unit <b>10</b>) between motor revolutions versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with respect to the gear rack <b>1910</b> based on revolution counts. After calibration, the depth can be set to maximum again so that the blocks can be removed without the need to raise the planter.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It should also be appreciated that the zero or home position need not be at the shallowest or deepest position. Instead, the zero or home position may be associated with a known depth between the shallowest and deepest settings (e.g., a two inch depth). By way of example, if it is desired to associate the zero or home position with a two inch trench depth (i.e., the permitted travel distance of the gauge wheels with respect to the opener disks), the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> may initially be placed at the shallowest or deepest setting and then a two inch thick block may be placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>2</b>. The motor <b>2030</b> may then be commanded to cause the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> to travel toward the shallowest or deepest position. As the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> moves toward the shallowest or deepest position, the motor revolutions are counted until a current spike is observed as the gauge wheels <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> start to contact the block. The position of the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> where the current spike is detected (i.e., at the two inch depth in this example) is established as the zero or home position. When the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is moved from the established zero or home position toward a deeper or shallower setting, the number of rotations of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b> (in the direction of the increase or decrease of the depth) are counted from the established zero or home position. As previously described, the linear relationship between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> based on revolution counts.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The above described calibration processes may be repeated for each row unit of the planter, which may be performed sequentially for each row unit or all row units may be calibrated simultaneously. It should be appreciated that only the zero or home position needs to be set, because the thickness of the block used under the gauge wheels is known which sets the trench depth. It should also be appreciated that not all rows need to be zeroed using the above methods. A subset of rows, for example, 50%, 33%, 25%, 20%, or any number less than 100%, may be zeroed or homed according to any of the above methods. The subset of rows that are zeroed are then averaged to provide an average zero or home that can then be applied across all rows equally or to the rows that were not zeroed.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">During the calibration process in any of the above examples for detecting the current spikes when the gauge wheels contact the blocks, a downforce sensor may be utilized to ensure consistent loading on the gauge wheels <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> across the various row units <b>10</b>. For example, a downforce system, such as the DeltaForce&#xae; system available from Precision Planting LLC, 23207 Townline Road, Tremont, Ill. 61568 (described in International Publication No. WO2014/018716), may be utilized to ensure consistent loading on the gauge wheels <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> at each row unit <b>10</b> to ensure uniform results across the agricultural implement.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It should also be appreciated that the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P may be manually calibrated by moving depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P to a zero or home location by activating manual button <b>2023</b> or <b>2024</b> to move depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When operating in a field, and in particular a no-till field, the gear rack <b>1910</b> could become filled with debris, which could limit the travel of the actuator <b>2050</b> on the gear rack <b>1910</b> causing an earlier current spike due to the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> or gear box <b>1920</b> abutting the debris filling the gear rack <b>1910</b> instead of the depth adjustment body or gear box <b>1920</b> abutting the positive stop on the gear rack <b>1910</b>. This earlier or premature current spike due to abutment with the debris will result in a false or incorrect home or zero position. Accordingly, it may be desirable to home or zero the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> at a midpoint of the gear rack <b>1910</b> or at some other point between either end of the gear rack <b>1910</b> where debris is unlikely to accumulate so as to avoiding a false or incorrect home or zero position.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> is a rear perspective view of another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>Q. In this embodiment, the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>Q is substantially the same as the previously described depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P, but incorporates a homing system <b>1970</b> for homing the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with respect to a position on the gear rack <b>1910</b> between the ends of the gear rack <b>1910</b>. The homing system <b>1970</b> includes a sensor <b>1971</b> and a target <b>1972</b>. The target <b>1972</b> may be a magnet, and the sensor <b>1971</b> may be a Hall effect sensor. Alternatively, the sensor <b>1971</b> may be an inductive sensor, and the target <b>1972</b> may be a metal block detectable by the inductive sensor. The sensor <b>1971</b> may be disposed on the gear box housing <b>1925</b> and the target <b>1972</b> may be disposed on the gear rack <b>1910</b>, such as on one edge <b>1912</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1912</b>-<b>2</b> of the shelf <b>1919</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1919</b>-<b>2</b> at the midpoint of travel along gear rack <b>1910</b> or at another point that is not at either end of gear rack <b>1910</b>. The sensor <b>1971</b> may be connected to circuit board <b>2020</b>, which may be in data communication with the monitor <b>50</b>. Home or zero is established when the sensor <b>1971</b> is disposed over the target <b>1972</b>. Thus, if the target <b>1972</b> is at the midpoint of the gear rack <b>1910</b>, then the home or zero will be the midpoint of gear rack <b>1910</b>. As previously described, the linear relationship between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> based on revolution counts in either direction from the zero or home position.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be appreciated that the homing system <b>1970</b> may be used in conjunction with or in the alternative to the zeroing or homing methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As a verification or check of the depth based on the number of revolution counts as described above, the revolution counts may be correlated with the angle of the actuator <b>2050</b> or the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> as detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b>. The correlation of the revolution counts with actual measured angles detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> will ensure proper depth calibration to account for variations in geometry of components from the manufacturer and to account for worn components on the row unit. A standard calibration equation may be used to correlate the depth setting (based on revolution counts) since there is a predetermined number of pulses from the magnet and Hall effect sensor that correlate to a predetermined depth change. For example, tests have shown that 250 revolution counts (producing 250 pulses from the magnet rotating past the Hall effect sensor) correlates to roughly a 0.11 inch (0.28 cm) change in furrow depth, and this change in furrow depth in relation to revolution counts is substantially linear across the entire depth range. Therefore, after calibrating to a known block thickness or to a home position using the homing system <b>1970</b>, the linear relationship between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b>. Similarly, if the change in planting depth is substantially linear in relation to revolution counts, the angle of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> as detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> can likewise be correlated using a standard calibration equation.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In addition, it is known that different soils, tillage practices and field conditions can affect actual trench depth in comparison to trench depth settings. Thus, for example, if the commanded depth is 2 inches (5 cm), but measurement of the actual depth in the field reveals that the seed trench is only 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), an offset to the calibration may be applied to &#x201c;true-up&#x201d; the position of the actuator <b>2050</b> or the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with the actual trench depth to account for field conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">It should be appreciated, however, that if the relationship between revolution counts with respect to change in depth across the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is not linear, a non-linear relationship may be required to correlate the depth with the revolution counts and with the measured angles detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b>. Such non-linear correlation would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">For any of the depth adjustment assemblies described herein that have a motor as part of their actuator (e.g., <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>, <b>1850</b>, <b>1950</b>, <b>2050</b>), the set depth can be determined by the motors <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1730</b>, <b>1830</b>, <b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2030</b> based on their rotations in either direction. If motors <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1730</b>, <b>1830</b>, <b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2030</b> are stepper motors, the number of steps taken in either direction can be tracked by depth control and soil monitoring system <b>300</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Diagnostics</heading>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The angles detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> may be used as a diagnostic tool of the Hall effect sensors on the row units by comparing the angles detected for the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> of one row unit with the readings of the accelerometers of the other row units on the planter. For example, if the angle detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> of one row unit is significantly different from the angles detected by the accelerometers <b>2014</b> of other row units, there may be a faulty Hall effect sensor not accurately counting revolutions of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Additionally, if a repair or alteration is made to the row unit and the actuator <b>2050</b> is installed in a different position than its original position, the accelerometer <b>2014</b> will detect this discrepancy in relation to the reading of the accelerometers <b>2014</b> of the other row units and the discrepancy may be displayed to the operator on the planter monitor to notify the operator that an adjustment is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Also, the SRM accelerometer may be referenced to verify the position of the actuator <b>2050</b>. For example, assuming the planter is operating on flat ground and the accelerometer <b>2014</b> and the actuator <b>2050</b> is at a 30 degree angle on the gear rack <b>1910</b>, but then the topography changes to a 10 degree uphill slope, this change in slope would cause the accelerometer <b>2014</b> to signal that the actuator <b>2050</b> has moved from its commanded position unexpectedly when in reality it is correct, but the topography changed. To avoid such false readings, the signals generated by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> are compared against the signals generated by the accelerometer on the SRM. Thus, as the topography changes, the gravity vector from the SRM changes and this gravity vector can be referenced in relation to the accelerometer <b>2014</b>, to confirm that the actuator <b>2050</b> did not move.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Additionally, the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b> can detect if there is a jamming situation in the actuator <b>2050</b> if the current spikes when the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is not near either end of travel on the gear rack <b>1910</b> and the Hall effect sensor fails to pick up any pulses indicating that the motor <b>2030</b> has stalled.</p>

As illustrated by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the rotation of the worm gear <b>3032</b> by the motor <b>3030</b> causes the gear wheel <b>3036</b> to rotate due to the engagement of the helical teeth <b>3033</b> with the notches <b>3035</b> of the gear wheel <b>3036</b>. The rotation of the gear wheel <b>3036</b> causes the shaft <b>3038</b> to rotate, which, in turn, pivots the clevis <b>3040</b>. Since the clevis <b>3040</b> is connected to the depth adjustment body <b>3044</b> by the link <b>3042</b>, the depth adjustment body <b>3044</b> is forced to pivot around the pivot <b>92</b>, thereby moving the rocker <b>95</b> as indicated by dashed lines. As previously explained, adjusting the position at which the rocker <b>95</b> engages with the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> limits the upward movement of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>, which, in turn, limits the upward travel of the bottom of the gauge wheels <b>52</b> relative to the bottom of the opening discs <b>62</b>, thereby setting the depth of penetration of the opening discs <b>62</b> into the soil surface and thus, the depth of the seed furrow <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The inductance sensor <b>7000</b> utilizes contactless inductive sensing to measure the position of a conductive target, an example of a commercially available inductance sensor is the LDC<b>131</b><i>x </i>or LDC <b>161</b><i>x </i>inductance sensor available from Texas Instruments. In a preferred embodiment, two inductive sensors <b>7002</b>, <b>7004</b> are secured to a sensor board <b>7006</b> which extends into the gearbox housing <b>3006</b>, <b>4006</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>6006</b>. The inductive sensors <b>7002</b>, <b>7004</b> comprise coiled copper with ferrite backing for shielding. The sensor board <b>7006</b> is secured to a wall of the gearbox housing <b>3006</b>, <b>4006</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>6006</b> to ensure repeatable and robust placement of the inductive sensors <b>7002</b>, <b>7004</b> relative to their respective targets <b>7008</b>, <b>7010</b>. The first inductive sensor <b>7002</b> is disposed on the sensor board <b>7006</b> relative to the first target <b>7008</b> which is secured to a stationary wall or surface of the gearbox housing <b>3006</b>, <b>4006</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>6006</b>. Thus, the first inductive sensor <b>7002</b> with its stationary target <b>7008</b> serves as a reference sensor to detect expansion or contraction of the gearbox housing that may occur due to temperature variations. The detected changes due to expansion or contraction of the gearbox housing may be used to true-up the measurements of the second inductive sensor <b>7004</b>. The second inductive sensor <b>7004</b> is disposed on the sensor board <b>7006</b> in line with the axis of the transverse shaft <b>3038</b>, <b>4038</b>, <b>5038</b>, <b>6038</b> to which the gear wheel <b>3036</b>, <b>4036</b>, <b>5036</b>, <b>6036</b> is rotationally fixed. The gear wheel <b>3036</b>, <b>4026</b>, <b>5036</b>, <b>6036</b> includes a cam <b>7020</b> having a non-concentric or eccentric curved surface <b>7022</b> resulting in an eccentric profile which serves as the second target <b>7010</b> for the second inductive sensor <b>7004</b>. Thus, it should be appreciated that as transverse shaft <b>3038</b>, <b>4038</b>, <b>5038</b>, <b>6038</b> is caused to rotate due to engagement of the gear wheel <b>3036</b>, <b>4036</b>, <b>5036</b>, <b>6036</b> with the rotating worm gear <b>3032</b>, <b>4032</b>, <b>5032</b>, <b>6032</b> rotated by the motor <b>3030</b>, <b>4030</b>, <b>5030</b>, <b>6030</b>, the relative distance between the second inductive sensor <b>7004</b> and the eccentric profile of the second target <b>7010</b> will vary. This change in relative position of the second target <b>7010</b> with respect to the stationary second inductive sensor <b>7004</b> will thus correspond to the position of the depth adjustment body <b>3044</b>, <b>4044</b>, <b>5044</b>, <b>6044</b>, and thus the position of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> which correspond to the depth of penetration of the opening disc <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">It should be appreciated that although the use of the reference sensor <b>7002</b> is preferred in order to take into account expansion or contraction of the gearbox housing for purposes of trueing-up the measurements of the second inductance sensor <b>7004</b>, the reference sensor <b>7002</b> may be omitted such that the inductive sensor <b>7000</b> utilizes only one inductive sensor.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Another absolute position sensor may be in the form of a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, whereby a change in the magnetic field is detected as one rotates relative to the other.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to some exemplary processes of controlling depth using the depth adjustment assemblies described herein, a user may manually adjust the primary and/or secondary depth adjustment assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">According to some exemplary processes, the user may manually adjust the primary depth adjustment assembly and may use the monitor <b>50</b> to command a depth adjustment to the secondary depth adjustment assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">According to some exemplary processes, the user may manually adjust the primary depth adjustment assembly and the monitor <b>50</b> may command a desired depth adjustment to the secondary depth adjustment assembly (e.g., one of the actuators/motors <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>) by receiving one or more agronomic variables from the sensors (e.g., sensors <b>350</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>365</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>385</b>) or from the soil data server <b>345</b> and determine a desired depth adjustment by consulting a database or algorithm relating one or more agronomic variables to a desired furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">According to some exemplary processes, the monitor <b>50</b> may command a desired depth adjustment to the depth adjustment assembly <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>, <b>1850</b>, <b>1950</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>, <b>3050</b>, <b>4050</b>, <b>5050</b>, <b>6050</b> by receiving one or more agronomic variables from the sensors (e.g., sensors <b>350</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>365</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>385</b>) or from the soil data server <b>345</b> and determine a desired depth adjustment by consulting a database or algorithm relating one or more agronomic variables to a desired furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">According to some exemplary processes, the monitor <b>50</b> may command a desired depth adjustment to the depth adjustment assembly <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>, <b>1850</b>, <b>1950</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>, <b>3050</b>, <b>4050</b>, <b>5050</b>, <b>6050</b> by determining the GPS-reported location of the row unit <b>10</b> and consulting a depth prescription map spatially relating locations and/or regions in the field to desired furrow depths.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Depth prescriptions are based on placing seeds at a proper depth to obtain desired germination and emergence. Factors that are used to determine a proper depth include, but are not limited to, soil type, organic matter content, moisture, soil temperature, soil texture, topography, and elevation. The depth prescription can be based on a combination of current temperature and moisture conditions in the field and the predicted temperature and moisture delivery from a weather forecast. This process is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2016/0037709, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In another embodiment, a minimum depth and a maximum depth set by an operator may be input into monitor <b>50</b> to control the desired depth within a range specified by the operator. The operator set minimum depth may be greater than the actual minimum depth obtainable by the depth adjustment assembly, and the operator set maximum depth may be less than the actual maximum depth obtainable by the depth adjustment assembly. This can be useful to constrain the depth to a desired depth range. For a given seed type, there can be a desired depth range for planting the seed so that the seed can germinate and emerge. When adjusting the depth based on a measured condition in the field, such as moisture, soil temperature, organic matter content, soil type, or soil texture using a sensor, such as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US2016/0037709, the sensor may signal a depth change to go to a depth that has the selected soil property, but while trying to change to a depth to achieve the selected property, the depth may be outside of the selected range. Having the operator set minimum and maximum depths keeps the seed in the desired depth range. As an example, an operator may want corn seed to be planted between 1.75&#x2033; and 2.5&#x2033;. If the sensor is measuring for moisture, and the moisture is insufficient at shallower depths, the depth adjustment mechanism would receive a signal to change to a deeper depth, but it can be constrained to stay within the operator selected range.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In some embodiments, the monitor <b>50</b> may record changes in depth in the field by associating commanded actuations of the actuator/motor <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>/<b>1730</b>, <b>1850</b>/<b>1830</b>, <b>1950</b>/<b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>/<b>2030</b>, <b>3050</b>/<b>3030</b>, <b>4050</b>/<b>4030</b>, <b>5050</b>/<b>5030</b>, <b>6050</b>/<b>6030</b> with GPS locations reported by the GPS receiver <b>52</b>. In some such embodiments, the monitor <b>50</b> may record a change in depth concurrently with the commanded actuations of the actuator/motor <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>/<b>1730</b>, <b>1850</b>/<b>1830</b>, <b>1950</b>/<b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>/<b>2030</b>, <b>3050</b>/<b>3030</b>, <b>4050</b>/<b>4030</b>, <b>5050</b>/<b>5030</b>, <b>6050</b>/<b>6030</b>. However, in operation, the force between the rocker <b>95</b> and the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment member may vary, e.g., as the row unit moves across uneven terrain. Thus, in some embodiments, the monitor <b>50</b> may monitor the force on the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment rocker and record the change in depth only when the force is lower than a predetermined threshold. For example, with respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the monitor <b>50</b> may monitor the force on the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment rocker and record the change in depth only when the force is lower than a predetermined threshold at which the depth adjustment member can be advanced for a given position of the actuator <b>1230</b>. The force on the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment rocker may be recorded by a load sensor such as a strain gauge mounted to the gauge wheel arm or other location through which the force is transmitted, or by a load sensing pin incorporated in the row unit as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In other implementations, the monitor <b>50</b> may command a temporary change (e.g., reduction) in row unit downforce applied by the downforce actuator <b>18</b> concurrently with (or before or after) a commanded change in the extension of the actuator/motor <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>/<b>1730</b>, <b>1850</b>/<b>1830</b>, <b>1950</b>/<b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>/<b>2030</b>, <b>3050</b>/<b>3030</b>, <b>4050</b>/<b>4030</b>, <b>5050</b>/<b>5030</b>, <b>6050</b>/<b>6030</b> in order to permit the depth adjustment. The monitor <b>50</b> may then command the row unit downforce applied by the actuator <b>18</b> to return to its previously commanded level.</p>

<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an agricultural attachment for cultivating row crops according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>, to an agricultural machine assembly according to the preamble of claim <b>11</b>, and to a method for cultivating row crops according to the preamble of claim <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to improve the results when cultivating farmland, plant rows are detected on the farmland during various cultivation processes. For this purpose, row-detection devices are used, which can be part of agricultural attachments, for example. Based on the row detection, a corrective movement can then be implemented on the attachment if the attachment is not optimally positioned or aligned to the plant rows.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The corrective movement on the attachment can be realized, for example, by means of a displacement frame that allows the relative position between the attachment and a drive vehicle on which the attachment is mounted to be adjusted. Document DE 10 2017 110 653 B3 discloses such a frame with a turning and displacing function.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Without technical row detection, correction of the position and alignment of the attachment relative to the plant rows has so far only been possible via manual steering intervention on the tractor or on the attachment. Steering intervention on the tractor results in a change in the direction of travel of the entire machine assembly. To perform a steering intervention on the attachment, for example, a so-called seat carrier is used for hoeing equipment, which is mounted on the hoeing equipment and on which a person can sit during a cultivation process. The person carries out manual adjustments to a displacement frame during the cultivation process in order to adjust the position of the hoeing device and its hoeing tools relative to the plant rows. Making such corrections manually, regardless of whether they are made on the tractor or the attachment, is exhausting and allows only comparatively low working speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The measures proposed in the prior art for improving the result when cultivating row crops are either extremely complex and thus only of limited practical suitability or only lead to a slight improvement in the cultivation result. For example, from document WO 2019/148220 A1, a hoeing device with adjustable working width is known. Document DE 10 2016 212 201 A1 proposes the alignment of an attachment via a lower link adjustment on the tractor. Document DE 10 2017 130 694 A1 discloses a working machine with its own steering device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The problem underlying the invention is thus to further improve the cultivation results when cultivating row crops by means of an agricultural attachment, without increasing the effort required for the cultivation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The problem is solved by an agricultural attachment of the kind introductorily mentioned, wherein the attachment according to the invention comprises a signal generating system which is adapted to generate steering commands for a drive vehicle on which the attachment is mounted, as a function of the locations and/or courses of plant rows detected by the row-detection device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Through the generation of steering commands, it can be achieved that the attachment positions itself in an intended manner to the plant rows and drives down the plant rows in an intended manner. The steering commands are ultimately used to cause the attachment to intervene in the steering of the drive vehicle. Based on the generation of steering commands, the machine assembly consisting of the drive vehicle and the attachment can also be caused to drive in a bend, if the plant rows each follow a curved row path within a section of the farmland. By initiating the steering intervention of the attachment on the drive vehicle, the driver of the drive vehicle is considerably relieved and the accuracy of row-related cultivation of a row crop is increased. Considerable cost savings can also be realized on the attachment, since a displacement device, such as a displacement frame, is not absolutely necessary on the attachment for aligning the attachment during cultivation and can therefore be dispensed with. However, a displacement frame offers additional advantages, particularly when driving bends, since the displacement frame can be used, for example, to precisely position the attachment when driving bends, taking into account the radius of the bend, the turning circle of the drive vehicle, and the dimensions of the attachment in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Furthermore, the drive vehicle is steered externally so that the drive vehicle does not necessarily have to have its own automatic steering system in order to be able to implement automated or partially automated cultivation. The attachment is preferably adapted to form a tractor element management (TIM) system together with a drive vehicle on which the attachment is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The signal generation device preferably comprises a data processing device, which is set up to evaluate data provided by the row-detection device and to calculate suitable steering interventions on the drive vehicle on the basis of the data evaluation. The drive vehicle can be, for example, a tractor that carries or pulls the attachment. The attachment may be adapted to be mounted at the front and/or the rear of the drive vehicle. The calculated steering interventions preferably take into account the attachment position of the attachment so that both an attachment mounted at the front of the drive vehicle and an attachment mounted at the rear of the drive vehicle can be guided precisely along the plant rows.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The signal generation device can be adapted to generate the steering commands for the drive vehicle also as a function of the dimensions and/or geometries of the drive vehicle and/or the attachment. For example, the wheelbase, turning radius and/or structural length of the drive vehicle and/or the distances of soil cultivation tools or spreading elements of the attachment to the axles of the drive vehicle can be taken into account when generating steering commands. Furthermore, the signal generation device can be adapted to generate the steering commands for the drive vehicle also as a function of tire positions, caster properties and/or pivoting properties of the attachment. The generation of steering commands can also take into account the position of a camera and/or the position of a sensor of the row-detection device. In this context, the longitudinal and/or transverse distance of the camera or sensor from the center of the drive vehicle is preferably taken into account. Corresponding data may be required for steering signal generation so that the pivot point of the attachment can be taken into account when steering the drive vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">If the attachment has a displacement frame or is coupled to a displacement frame, this displacement frame can also be controlled as a function of the signals from the row-detection device. Preferably, the displacement frame has an automatic adjustment device that uses the signals from the row-detection device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Taking into account the course and/or locations of the plant rows, the relative position between the displacement frame and the drive vehicle can then always be optimally adjusted. A displacement frame thus allows positioning of the soil cultivation tools or the spreading elements of the attachment during driving in a bend, which takes into account the bend radius, the turning radius of the drive vehicle and the dimensions of the attachment in the longitudinal and transverse directions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, the agricultural attachment according to the invention has a communication device which is adapted to exchange data bidirectionally with a control unit of the drive vehicle. The steering commands for the drive vehicle generated by the signal generation device can be transmitted to the drive vehicle via the communication device. The data exchange between the communication device of the attachment and the control unit of the drive vehicle can be wired or wireless. A bus system of the drive vehicle can be used for communication between the communication device of the attachment and the control unit of the drive vehicle, wherein the generated steering commands are transmitted in this case, for example, as bus messages to the control unit of the drive vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further preferred embodiment, the agricultural attachment according to the invention has a plurality of soil cultivation tools spaced apart from one another transversely to the direction of travel. The signal generation device is preferably adapted to generate the steering commands for the drive vehicle for correcting relative positions between plant rows and soil cultivation tools. The attachment can be a hoe, for example. The soil cultivation tools can be hoeing tools, for example. Deviations between the target positions and the actual positions of the soil cultivation tools are compensated for by the steering of the drive vehicle, which is caused by the generated steering commands.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another preferred embodiment, the agricultural attachment according to the invention comprises a plurality of spreading elements spaced apart transversely to the direction of travel, wherein the signal generation device is arranged to generate the steering commands for the drive vehicle to correct relative positions between plant rows and spreading elements. The attachment may be, for example, a crop protection sprayer. The spreading elements may be spray nozzles. The spray nozzles of a crop protection sprayer are usually arranged above the plant rows. The spray liquid applied is often intended to treat only a band of plants and not the entire plant stand, so that precise positioning of the spray nozzles relative to the plant rows is required. Deviations between the target positions and the actual positions of the spreading elements are compensated for via the steering of the drive vehicle. The attachment can also have a steerable axle so that deviations between the target positions and the actual positions of the spreading elements can be compensated alternatively or additionally via the steering of the attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, an agricultural attachment according to the invention is preferred, in which the signal generation device is arranged to generate speed setting commands for the drive vehicle. Through the speed setting commands, the attachment can cause a change in the travel speed of the drive vehicle. Thus, for example, the attachment can cause a reduction in speed when driving the machine assembly in a bend is required or when row detection is imprecise. Reducing the speed also provides the operator with the opportunity to manually intervene in the control of the attachment and/or the drive vehicle. Appropriate bend driving may be required if the plant rows follow arcuate row paths, for example in the edge area of a farmland or in the vicinity of an obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The agricultural attachment according to the invention is further preferably further embodied in that the signal generation device is adapted to generate speed setting commands for the drive vehicle as a function of the locations and/or courses of plant rows detected by the row-detection device. If a straight row course is detected, the travel speed of the drive vehicle can be increased without impairing the cultivation result, since in this case few steering interventions are required. If a curved or arc-shaped row course is detected, the travel speed of the drive vehicle can be reduced to avoid affecting the cultivation result. In this case, the travel speed must be reduced to such an extent that the movement path of the drive vehicle and the attachment can be adapted to the course of the row within a tolerance range by means of steering interventions. A reduction in the travel speed may be necessary in particular if the control speed of the drive vehicle is not sufficient to be able to implement the necessary steering interventions in good time.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The agricultural attachment can be predetermined a permissible speed range within which an automatic adjustment of the travel speed by the attachment can be initiated. The permissible speed range can be predefined at the factory and/or can be set by the operator. By specifying the permissible speed range, excessive travel speeds in particular are avoided, which can lead to impairment of the cultivation result, for example by excessive burial due to excessive earth movement.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternatively or additionally, the signal generation device may be adapted to generate the speed setting commands for the drive vehicle as a function of a control speed of the drive vehicle and/or the direction of movement of the attachment relative to the detected plant rows. If the drive vehicle has a comparatively low control speed, the travel speed of the drive vehicle must be adapted to the sluggish control behavior. The higher the control speed of the drive vehicle, the higher the travel speed of the drive vehicle can be set, since the responsiveness of the machine assembly also increases with the control speed of the drive vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, an agricultural attachment according to the invention is preferred, which comprises an evaluation device, wherein the evaluation device is adapted to evaluate the result of the cultivation of the row crops during a cultivation process with regard to at least one cultivation criterion dependent on the driving speed. In the case of hoeing, for example, the degree of burial of the plants by the upturned earth stream represents a processing criterion dependent on travel speed. If the travel speed is too high, the plants will be buried to an unintended degree by the upturned earth stream. In this case, the evaluation device can be adapted to detect the degree of burial of the plants, wherein the detection of the degree of burial can, for example, be camera-based and/or sensor-based. The signal generation device is preferably adapted to generate speed setting commands for the drive vehicle depending on the result of the cultivation of the row crops evaluated by the evaluation device. The travel speed is therefore adjusted depending on the quality of the work achieved. If the cultivation result is outside an acceptable tolerance range, the signal generation device preferably causes the travel speed to be reduced. If the cultivation result is within a tolerance range, the signal generation device can cause the travel speed to be increased so that the cultivation time is reduced. The evaluation device can be integrated into the row-detection device. Furthermore, the evaluation device can use one or more cameras and/or one or more sensors of the row-detection device to evaluate the cultivation result.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment, the agricultural attachment according to the invention comprises a rotation rate sensor which is adapted to detect a change in alignment of the attachment relative to the longitudinal direction of the plant rows, wherein the row-detection device is adapted to detect the locations and/or courses of plant rows on the farmland taking into account the change in alignment of the attachment detected by the rotation rate sensor. Steering movements on the drive vehicle result in a change of alignment and thus a skewing of the attachment. The skew affects the row detection, for example due to the skew of one or more cameras or one or more sensors. The skewing of a camera results in a changed acquisition angle. The skewing of a sensor results in a changed detection angle. The changed acquisition and/or detection angles can distort the row detection. The sensor data from the rotation rate sensor is provided to the row detection so that the camera images or sensor data can be corrected taking into account the change in alignment of the attachment. The rotation rate sensor may be a yaw rate sensor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further preferred embodiment, the agricultural attachment according to the invention comprises an inclination sensor which is arranged to detect an inclination of the attachment relative to a horizontal axis, the soil of the farmland, a leaf canopy and/or a crop top. The signal generation device is preferably adapted to generate steering commands for the drive vehicle also as a function of the inclination of the attachment detected by the inclination sensor. When cultivating on a slope, this enables early slope countercorrection, if the drive vehicle threatens to slip away on the slope or has already slipped away. The inclination sensor allows early detection of a drift situation so that the drift of the machine assembly on the slope can be counteracted at an early stage via a steering intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The row-detection device can also be adapted to detect the locations and/or courses of plant rows on the farmland, taking into account the inclination of the attachment detected by the inclination sensor. When cultivating on a slope, an angle of inclination is established on the drive vehicle and the attachment. The inclination affects the row detection, for example by an associated inclination of one or more cameras and/or one or more sensors. This leads to changed acquisition or detection angles, so that the row detection is distorted. The sensor data of the inclination sensor is made available to the row-detection device so that the camera images or sensor data can be evaluated taking into account the current device inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another preferred embodiment of the agricultural attachment according to the invention, the row-detection device comprises one or more cameras for row detection. Alternatively or additionally, the row-detection device comprises one or more sensors for row detection. Alternatively or additionally, the row-detection device comprises one or more sensors for row detection. The sensors can be ultrasonic sensors, for example. The row sensors can be used, for example, for row detection in a plant stand where stable plant stems are present. Thus, a row-detection device with one or more row sensors can be used, in particular, for row detection in a corn crop. Furthermore, the agricultural attachment can be adapted to detect real-time kinematics (RTK) signals so that the steering commands for the drive vehicle can also be generated taking into account the detected RTK signals.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, a groove could be made in the soil of the farmland during sowing, wherein the groove runs equidistant to a plant row, for example. The groove created during the sowing process can then be detected, for example, with a sensing wheel of the row-detection device. The sensing wheel preferably has a sensor so that the courses and/or locations of the plant rows can be determined via the sensory detection of the groove created during sowing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The problem underlying the invention is further solved by an agricultural machine assembly of the kind introductorily mentioned, wherein the agricultural attachment of the agricultural machine assembly according to the invention is configured according to one of the embodiments described above and the drive vehicle is adapted to automatically execute a steering operation on the basis of steering commands from the attachment. With regard to the advantages and modifications of the agricultural machine assembly according to the invention, reference is first made to the advantages and modifications of the attachment according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The drive vehicle can be a tractor, for example. The drive vehicle is preferably adapted to automatically adjust the travel speed on the basis of speed setting commands from the attachment. The agricultural machine assembly is thus controlled automatically on the basis of the row detection so that no steering and/or speed setting interventions are required by the driver of the drive vehicle during the cultivation of the farmland.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The problem underlying the invention is further solved by a method of the kind introductorily mentioned, wherein, within the framework of the method according to the invention, steering commands for a drive vehicle of the machine assembly, on which the attachment is mounted, are generated by means of a signal generation device of the attachment as a function of the locations and/or courses of plant rows detected by the row-detection device. The steering commands generated by the signal generation device are then transmitted to a control unit of the drive vehicle. The drive vehicle then automatically performs a steering operation based on the transmitted steering commands from the attachment. The method for cultivating row crops according to the invention is preferably carried out by means of an agricultural machine assembly according to one of the embodiments described above and/or using an agricultural attachment according to one of the embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, speed setting commands for the drive vehicle are generated by means of the signal generation device of the attachment. The speed setting commands are preferably generated as a function of the locations and/or courses of plant rows detected by the row-detection device. The speed setting commands generated by the signal generation device are preferably transmitted to a control unit of the drive vehicle so that the drive vehicle can automatically set the travel speed on the basis of the transmitted speed setting commands of the attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, a method according to the invention is preferred, in which the result of the cultivation of the row crops during a cultivation process is evaluated with regard to at least one cultivation criterion dependent on driving speed by means of an evaluation device of the attachment. The speed setting commands for the drive vehicle are preferably generated as a function of the result of the cultivation of the row crops evaluated by the evaluation device. Alternatively or additionally, a change in the alignment of the attachment relative to the longitudinal direction of the plant rows is detected by means of a rotation rate sensor of the attachment. The detection of the locations and/or courses of plant rows on the farmland is preferably carried out taking into account the change in the alignment of the attachment detected by the rotation rate sensor.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cross member <b>12</b> is supported relative to the ground of the farmland <b>200</b> via the wheels <b>16</b><i>a, </i><b>16</b><i>b </i>of the attachment <b>10</b>. The cross member <b>12</b> is connected to the front coupling device of the drive vehicle <b>102</b> via an adjustment device <b>18</b> in the form of a displacement frame.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The adjustment device <b>18</b> may include one or more adjustment drives by which the cross member <b>12</b> may be moved and/or pivoted longitudinally and/or transversely to position the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>centrally between the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l</i>. Further, the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>may be movable along the cross member <b>12</b> and/or pivotable relative to the cross member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The attachment <b>10</b> is equipped with a row-detection device <b>20</b>, via which the locations and courses of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l </i>on the farmland <b>200</b> can be detected during a cultivation process. The row-detection device <b>20</b> comprises a camera <b>22</b> for row detection. Alternatively or additionally, the row detection device <b>20</b> could also comprise one or more sensors and/or one or more sensing devices for row detection. The camera <b>22</b> has an imaging area <b>24</b>, wherein the locations and courses of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>b, </i><b>202</b><i>c </i>located in the imaging area <b>24</b> can be detected by the row-detection device <b>22</b>. The location and course detection of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>b, </i><b>202</b><i>c </i>is performed by an evaluation of the image recordings acquired by the camera <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The agricultural attachment <b>10</b> may include a rotation rate sensor for sensing a change in the alignment of the attachment <b>10</b> relative to the longitudinal direction of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l</i>. The change in alignment of the attachment <b>10</b> for results in a skewed position of the attachment <b>10</b>, which changes the angle of view of the camera <b>22</b>. Through the change in the alignment of the attachment <b>10</b> detected by the rotation rate sensor, the changed shooting angle of the camera <b>22</b> can be taken into account in the row detection so that the courses and locations of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>b, </i><b>202</b><i>c </i>are determined with a higher degree of precision. Thus, the camera images of the camera <b>22</b> are evaluated taking into account the current skewed position of the attachment <b>10</b> and thus taking into account the current skewed position of the camera <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The agricultural attachment <b>10</b> further includes a signal generation device <b>26</b> that generates steering commands for the drive vehicle <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The signal generation device <b>26</b> generates the steering commands for the drive vehicle <b>102</b> as a function of to the locations and courses of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>202</b><i>c </i>detected by the row-detection device <b>20</b>. Through the steering command generation, it is achieved that the attachment <b>10</b> traverses the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l </i>of the farmland <b>200</b> in an intended manner, namely such that the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>are always arranged centrally between the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l</i>. The steering commands generated by the signal generation device <b>26</b> ultimately cause a steering intervention on the drive vehicle <b>102</b> initiated by the attachment <b>10</b>. Consequently, the drive vehicle <b>102</b> is steered externally so that no manual steering intervention by the vehicle driver is required. Furthermore, a lane detection system can be dispensed with on the drive vehicle <b>102</b>, since an automatic steering system exclusively on the vehicle side is not required.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this case, the row-detection device <b>20</b> of the attachment <b>10</b> is arranged in a front area of the drive vehicle <b>102</b>.

The speed adjustment commands are generated as a function of the locations and courses of the plant rows <b>202</b><i>e</i>-<b>202</b><i>h </i>detected by the row-detection device <b>20</b>. Consequently, through the speed adjustment commands, the attachment <b>10</b> can cause a change in the travel speed of the drive vehicle <b>102</b>. When a straight row course is detected, the travel speed of the drive vehicle <b>102</b> can be increased without affecting the cultivation result because few critical steering interventions are required in this case. When a curved row course is detected, the travel speed of the drive vehicle <b>102</b> can be reduced to avoid affecting the cultivation result. In this case, the travel speed should be reduced at least enough to achieve a cultivation result that is within a tolerance range through steering interventions.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to check whether the cultivation result is within a tolerance range, the attachment <b>10</b> may further comprise an evaluation device, via which the result of the cultivation of the row crops during the cultivation process is evaluated with respect to a driving speed-dependent evaluation criterion. The evaluation device may be adapted to determine the degree of burial of the crops by the soil flow thrown up during the cultivation. The degree of burial of the plants by the thrown-up earth stream must not leave a tolerance range during the cultivation process. In the event that the degree of burial of the plants by the thrown-up earth stream leaves the tolerance range, the signal generation device <b>26</b> generates a speed adjustment command which results in a reduction in the travel speed of the drive vehicle <b>102</b>.</p>

The skewed orientation a of the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>also results in the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>not being positioned centrally between the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l. </i></p>

Based on the row detection that has occurred, the signal generation device <b>26</b> generates steering commands that are transmitted to a control unit <b>104</b> of the drive vehicle <b>102</b> via the data link <b>106</b>.

Via the steering movement L at the front axle of the drive vehicle <b>102</b>, a correction of the positioning of the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>is effected so that the soil cultivating tools <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>m </i>again move centrally between the plant rows <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>l </i>through the soil of the farmland <b>200</b> without skewing.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a travel line creation system for an agricultural machine such as a tractor.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2006-204174, when an agricultural machine to which a transplanter is attached as a working device performs planting work in an agricultural field, the agricultural machine travels back and forth and performs planting in an inner area with a headland of the agricultural field left unplanted and then travels and performs planting in the headland surrounding the inner area.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, depending on a positional relationship between a work start point where the transplanter starts the planting work, a work end point where the transplanter ends the planting work, etc., and the entrance/exit of the agricultural field, the agricultural machine may travel to a place where the planting work has already been done when the agricultural machine moves out of the agricultural field or moves to another place after the completion of traveling and planting in the headland area surrounding the inner area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide travel line creation systems for agricultural machines that each enable the agricultural machine, when the agricultural machine performs work while traveling along a travel line surrounding the inner area of an agricultural field and moves out of the agricultural field or moves to another place or the like, to avoid traveling a place where the work has already been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A travel line creation system for an agricultural machine according to an aspect of an example embodiment of the present invention includes a position acquirer to acquire position measurement points obtained when the agricultural machine to which a working device is attachable makes a round in an agricultural field, a display to display a field that represents the agricultural field, a first generator to associate the position measurement points with the field displayed by the display and generate creation points on the field by shifting the position measurement points inward in the agricultural field, a second generator to create a travel line including a loop which passes through the creation points generated by the first generator and calculate each of virtual lines by connecting together adjacent ones of the creation points on the travel line, and a setter to extract, from the virtual lines generated by the second generator, a pair of virtual lines adjacent to each other and extending different directions and set, as a work point regarding a breakpoint in work performed by the working device, one of the creation points that is shared by the extracted pair of virtual lines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If there are a plurality of the pairs of virtual lines, the setter may extract a particular pair of virtual lines defining an angle not less than a criterion value from the plurality of pairs of virtual lines, and set, as the work point, one of the creation points that is shared by the extracted particular pair of virtual lines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If there are candidates for the work point, the setter may extract a particular pair of virtual lines defining an internal angle less than about 180&#xb0; from a plurality of the extracted pairs of virtual lines, and set, as the work point, one of the creation points that is shared by the extracted particular pair of virtual lines.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If there are candidates for the work point, the setter may set, as the work point, one of the candidates that is nearest to an entrance-and-exit of the agricultural field.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The second generator may set, as the travel line, a headland work line to perform work on a headland of the agricultural field.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The setter may set a work start point, a work end point, a pause point, or a work preparation point of the working device as the work point.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second generator may generate, as a plurality of the travel lines, paths adjacent to each other in a direction from a central portion of the field outward. The setter may set, respectively for the paths adjacent to each other, a plurality of the work points at different positions in a direction in which the paths extend.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained while referring to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a travel line creation system S that creates a travel line L along which an agricultural machine <b>1</b> travels when the agricultural machine <b>1</b> performs work while making a round in an agricultural field H. The travel line creation system S creates the travel line L along which the agricultural machine <b>1</b> is able to perform work in the agricultural field H and then to move to the outside of the agricultural field H or move to another place or the like while avoiding traveling a place where the work has already been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, the agricultural machine <b>1</b> will now be explained. The agricultural machine <b>1</b> is a machine to which a working device <b>2</b> can be attached, for example, a tractor, a rice transplanter, or the like as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. In the description below, a tractor is taken as an example of the agricultural machine <b>1</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the tractor <b>1</b> includes a traveling vehicle <b>3</b>, a prime mover <b>4</b>, and a transmission <b>5</b>. The traveling vehicle <b>3</b> includes a traveling device <b>7</b>. The traveling device <b>7</b> is a device including front wheels <b>7</b>F and rear wheels <b>7</b>R. The front wheels <b>7</b>F may be of a tire type or a crawler type. The rear wheels <b>7</b>R may also be of a tire type or a crawler type. The prime mover <b>4</b> is a diesel engine, an electric motor, or the like. The transmission <b>5</b> is capable of switching a propelling force of the traveling device <b>7</b> by shifting gears and is also capable of switching the traveling device <b>7</b> between forward traveling and rearward traveling. A cabin <b>9</b> is provided on the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>. An operator's seat <b>10</b> is provided inside the cabin <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a lifting device <b>8</b> that includes a three-point linkage and the like is provided at a rear portion of the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>. The working device <b>2</b> can be detachably attached to the lifting device <b>8</b>. Coupling the working device <b>2</b> to the lifting device <b>8</b> enables the traveling vehicle <b>3</b> to tow the working device <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tractor <b>1</b> includes a steering device <b>11</b>. The steering device <b>11</b> includes a steering wheel <b>11</b><i>a</i>, a rotation shaft (steering shaft) <b>11</b><i>b </i>that rotates with rotation of the steering wheel <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and an assist mechanism (power steering mechanism) <b>11</b><i>c </i>that assists steering of the steering wheel <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The assist mechanism <b>11</b><i>c </i>includes a hydraulic pump <b>21</b>, a control valve <b>22</b> to which a hydraulic fluid delivered from the hydraulic pump <b>21</b> is supplied, and a steering cylinder <b>23</b> that is operated by the control valve <b>22</b>. The control valve <b>22</b> is a solenoid valve that is activated based on a control signal. The control valve <b>22</b> is, for example, a three-position switching valve that can be switched by the movement of a spool or the like. The control valve <b>22</b> can be switched also by the steering of the steering shaft <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The steering cylinder <b>23</b> is connected to arms (knuckle arms) <b>24</b> configured to change the direction of the front wheels <b>7</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, when the steering wheel <b>11</b><i>a </i>is operated, the switching position and the opening of the control valve <b>22</b> are switched in accordance with the steering wheel <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and the steering cylinder <b>23</b> extends or retracts to the left or right in accordance with the switching position and opening of the control valve <b>22</b>. As a result, it is possible to change the steering direction of the front wheels <b>7</b>F. The steering device <b>11</b> described above is a mere example, and its configuration is not limited to the configuration described above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the lifting device <b>8</b> includes lift arm(s) <b>8</b><i>a</i>, lower link(s) <b>8</b><i>b</i>, a top link <b>8</b><i>c</i>, lift rod(s) <b>8</b><i>d</i>, and lift cylinder(s) <b>8</b><i>e</i>. The front end portions of the lift arms <b>8</b><i>a </i>are supported in such a way as to be able to move pivotally upward/downward on rear upper portions of a case (transmission case) in which the transmission <b>5</b> is housed. The lift arms <b>8</b><i>a </i>move pivotally (are raised and lowered) when driven by the lift cylinders <b>8</b><i>e</i>. The lift cylinders <b>8</b><i>e </i>are hydraulic cylinders. The lift cylinders <b>8</b><i>e </i>are connected to a hydraulic pump through a control valve. The control valve is a solenoid valve or the like and causes the lift cylinders <b>8</b><i>e </i>to extend and retract.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The front end portions of the lower links <b>8</b><i>b </i>are supported in such a way as to be able to move pivotally upward/downward on rear lower portions of the transmission <b>5</b>. The front end portion of the top link <b>8</b><i>c </i>is supported in such a way as to be able to move pivotally upward/downward behind the transmission <b>5</b> above the lower links <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The lift rods <b>8</b><i>d </i>link the lift arms <b>8</b><i>a </i>to the lower links <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The working device <b>2</b> is coupled to the rear portions of the lower links <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the rear portion of the top link <b>8</b><i>c</i>. When the lift cylinders <b>8</b><i>e </i>are driven (to extend or retract), the lift arms <b>8</b><i>a </i>are raised or lowered, and the lower links <b>8</b><i>b</i>, which are linked to the lift arms <b>8</b><i>a </i>via the lift rods <b>8</b><i>d</i>, are raised or lowered. As a result, the working device <b>2</b> moves upward or downward (is raised or lowered), with the front portions of the lower links <b>8</b><i>b </i>acting as fulcrums.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tractor <b>1</b> includes a positioning device <b>40</b>. The positioning device <b>40</b> is capable of detecting its position (measured position information including latitude and longitude) by using a satellite positioning system (positioning satellites) such as D-GPS, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo, Michibiki, or the like. That is, the positioning device <b>40</b> receives satellite signal(s) (positions of the positioning satellites, transmission times, correction information, etc.) transmitted from the positioning satellites, and detects the position (for example, latitude and longitude) of the tractor <b>1</b>, namely, a vehicle-body position VP, based on the satellite signals. The positioning device <b>40</b> includes a receiver <b>41</b> and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) <b>42</b>. The receiver <b>41</b> is a device including an antenna and the like and configured to receive satellite signals transmitted from the positioning satellites. The receiver <b>41</b> is mounted on the traveling vehicle <b>3</b> separately from the inertial measurement unit <b>42</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, the receiver <b>41</b> is mounted on the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>, specifically, on the cabin <b>9</b>. The position where the receiver <b>41</b> is mounted is not limited to the position described in the present preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The inertial measurement unit <b>42</b> includes an acceleration sensor that detects an acceleration, a gyroscope sensor that detects an angular speed, and the like. The inertial measurement unit <b>42</b> is disposed in the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>, for example, below the operator's seat <b>10</b>, and is capable of detecting a roll angle, a pitch angle, a yaw angle, and the like of the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tractor <b>1</b> includes a controller <b>60</b>. The controller <b>60</b> is a device that controls a traveling system, a working system, and the like in the tractor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The controller <b>60</b> includes an automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> that controls automatic traveling of the tractor <b>1</b>. The automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> includes electric/electronic circuit(s) provided in the controller <b>60</b>, program(s) stored in a CPU, etc., and/or the like. Upon start of automatic traveling, the automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> controls the control valve <b>22</b> of the steering device <b>11</b> such that the traveling vehicle <b>3</b> travels along a planned travel route L that has been set in advance. Moreover, upon start of automatic traveling, the automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> controls the velocity (vehicle speed) of the tractor <b>1</b> by automatically changing the gear-shift position of the transmission <b>5</b>, the number of revolutions of the prime mover <b>4</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in a situation where the tractor <b>1</b> is traveling automatically, if a deviation of the vehicle-body position VP from the planned travel route L is less than a threshold value, the automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> keeps the rotation angle of the steering shaft (rotation shaft) <b>11</b><i>b</i>. If the deviation of the vehicle-body position VP from the planned travel route L is not less than the threshold value and, in addition, the tractor <b>1</b> is located to the left of the planned travel route L, the automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> causes the steering shaft <b>11</b><i>b </i>to rotate so as to steer the tractor <b>1</b> to the right. If the deviation of the vehicle-body position VP from the planned travel route L is not less than the threshold value and, in addition, the tractor <b>1</b> is located to the right of the planned travel route L, the automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> causes the steering shaft <b>11</b><i>b </i>to rotate so as to steer the tractor <b>1</b> to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the preferred embodiment described above, the steering angle of the steering device <b>11</b> is changed based on the deviation of the vehicle-body position VP from the planned travel route L. However, in a case where the azimuth (vehicle-body azimuth) F<b>1</b> of the direction in which the tractor <b>1</b> (the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>) is headed (the traveling direction) is different from the azimuth of the planned travel route L, that is, if the angle &#x3b8;g of the vehicle-body azimuth F<b>1</b> relative to the planned travel route L is not less than a threshold value, the automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> may set the steering angle such that the angle &#x3b8;g will become zero (the vehicle-body azimuth F<b>1</b> will match the azimuth of the planned travel route L). The automatic-travel controller <b>61</b> may, based on a steering angle calculated based on the position (position deviation) and a steering angle calculated based on the azimuth (azimuth deviation), set a final steering angle in automatic steering. The setting of the steering angle in automatic steering according to the preferred embodiment described above is a mere example and is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tractor <b>1</b> (the traveling vehicle <b>3</b>) is capable of traveling automatically while being controlled by the controller <b>60</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The controller <b>60</b> is capable of performing manual raising and lowering control, automatic raising control, and the like. In the manual raising and lowering control, based on an operation of a raising/lowering switch <b>72</b> connected to the controller <b>60</b>, the lifting device <b>8</b> is controlled to raise or lower the working device <b>2</b>.

With this configuration, the agricultural machine <b>1</b> performs an operation regarding a breakpoint in work at a bent or curved portion of the travel line L that extends in different directions.

Therefore, when the agricultural machine <b>1</b> moves to the outside of the agricultural field H, the agricultural machine <b>1</b> is capable of putting an end to work at a position where the angle is relatively large and leaving the travel line L while avoiding traveling on the place where work has already been performed.</p>

With this configuration, even in a case where a portion of the travel line L is recessed, it is possible to exclude the recessed portion from candidates for the work point Rn. Therefore, when the agricultural machine <b>1</b> moves to the outside of the agricultural field H, the agricultural machine <b>1</b> is capable of putting an end to work at a position protruding outward on the perimeter of the agricultural field H and leaving the travel line L, and therefore it is possible to avoid traveling on the place where work has already been performed.</p>

With this configuration, when the agricultural machine <b>1</b> performs work on an area located inward of the headland and performs work on the headland while making a round on the headland, it is possible to increase efficiency of the work on the headland and efficiency of the movement from the headland work line Ln to the outside of the agricultural field H.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The setter may set a work start point, a work end point, a pause point, or a work preparation point of the working device <b>2</b> as the work point Rn.

With the configuration, when the agricultural machine moves from one travel line L to its adjacent travel line L, the agricultural machine moves to a position displaced along the direction of extension of the travel lines L, thus making it possible to avoid, to a greater extent, traveling on the place where work has already been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">An agricultural machine <b>1</b> includes the travel line creation system S for an agricultural machine <b>1</b> described above. This configuration makes it possible to provide an agricultural machine <b>1</b> that achieves the advantageous effect(s) described above.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are a wide variety of different types of farming techniques. One such technique is referred to as precision farming. Precision farming, or precision agriculture, is also referred to as site-specific crop management. The technique uses observation and measurement of variations of different criteria at specific sites, from field-to-field, and even within a single field. The observation and measurement of the variation in the different criteria can then be acted on in different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The effectiveness of precision farming depends, at least in part, upon the timely gathering of information at a site-specific level, so that information can be used to make better decisions in treating and managing the crop. This type of information can include information that is indicative of plant emergence characteristics (such as maturity, emergence uniformity, etc.) pest presence, disease, water and nutrient levels, weed stresses, etc. Management techniques for weeds, which reduce crop yields, include the application of a chemical (e.g., herbicide) to the field to mitigate weed growth.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present description generally relates to agricultural machines. More specifically, but not by limitation, the present description relates to pre-emergence weed detection and mitigation. As noted above, some weed management techniques including the application of a chemical (e.g., herbicide) to an agricultural field to mitigate weed growth. For sake of the present discussion, a &#x201c;weed&#x201d; or &#x201c;weed plant&#x201d; refers to any plant other than a target crop plant type of the subject field. This can include non-crop plants as well as crop plants of a different crop type. To illustrate, in a corn field to be harvested by a corn harvester, &#x201c;weeds&#x201d; can include common non-crop plants (e.g., giant ragweed, common ragweed, horseweed (marestail), johnsongrass, palmer amaranth, ryegrass, waterhemp, etc.) and crop plants other than corn (e.g., soybeans, etc.). That is, it includes plant types other corn plants.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Unfortunately, over time some types of weeds have developed herbicide-resistance which results in decreased effectiveness of the herbicide application. For instance, examples of weeds that have developed glyphosate resistance include, but are not limited to, those mentioned above. At best, the herbicide-resistance requires an excessive application of the herbicide and, at worst, the herbicide-resistance renders the herbicide application ineffective. Further, excessive application of herbicide has drawbacks. For instance, in addition to a significant increase in costs involved (e.g., machine operating costs, herbicide costs, etc.), excessive herbicide application may be harmful to the crop and/or is otherwise undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One pre-emergence application technique utilizes weed maps and an expected timing of emergence to determine when to apply a pre-emergence herbicide. These maps are obtained from weed growing locations from prior year growing seasons or harvest, to predict where the weeds will emerge for the current year. This is often inaccurate, which can result in incorrect herbicide application doses and/or the application of herbicide to the incorrect areas of the field.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure provides a system for an agricultural environment that processes weed plant location information, such as weed maps, that supports pre-emergence mitigation. The weed plant data can be obtained from any of a wide variety of sources, such as remote sensing data obtained from image data sources. Examples of image data sources include, but are not limited to, manned aircraft cameras, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) cameras, stationary mounted or on-board cameras, etc. For sake of illustration, as discussed below an agricultural harvester or combine identifies the locations of weed seeds, which can be utilized to control on-board weed seed mitigators. Alternatively, or in addition, weed seed maps can be generated and utilized to perform pre-emergence weed mitigation post-harvest. In either case, the system can mitigate even herbicide-resistance weeds.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one example of an agricultural architecture <b>100</b> for pre-emergence weed mitigation. Architecture <b>100</b> includes an agricultural machine <b>102</b> configured to generate pre-emergence weed seed location information that represents the presence of weed seeds in a field and/or perform a pre-emergence weed mitigation operation using that weed seed location information. It is noted that machine <b>102</b> can be any of a wide variety of different types of agricultural machines. For instance, in examples described below machine <b>102</b> comprises an agricultural harvesting machine (also referred to as a &#x201c;harvester&#x201d; or &#x201c;combine&#x201d;). In other examples, machine <b>102</b> can comprise a sprayer, cultivator, to name a few.

In one example, communication system <b>112</b> communicates over a controller area network (CAN) bus (or another network, such as an Ethernet network, etc.) to communicate information between those items. This information can include the various sensor signals and output signals generated by the sensor variables and/or sensed variables.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Control system <b>108</b> includes a user interface component <b>127</b> configured to control interfaces, such as operator interface(s) <b>128</b> that include input mechanisms configured to receive input from an operator <b>130</b> and output mechanisms that render outputs to operator <b>130</b>. The user input mechanisms can include mechanisms such as hardware buttons, switches, joysticks, keyboards, etc., as well as virtual mechanisms or actuators such as a virtual keyboard or actuators displayed on a touch sensitive screen. The output mechanisms can include display screens, speakers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Sensor(s) <b>120</b> can include any of a wide variety of different types of sensors. In the illustrated example, sensors <b>120</b> include position sensor(s) <b>132</b>, speed sensor(s) <b>134</b>, environmental sensor(s) <b>136</b>, and can include other types of sensors <b>138</b> as well. Position sensor(s) <b>132</b> are configured to determine a geographic position of machine <b>102</b> on the field, and can include, but are not limited to, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver that receives signals from a GNSS satellite transmitter. It can also include a Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) component that is configured to enhance the precision of position data derived from the GNSS signal. Speed sensor(s) <b>134</b> are configured to determine a speed at which machine <b>102</b> is traveling the field during the spraying operation. This can include sensors that sense the movement of ground-engaging elements (e.g., wheels or tracks) and/or can utilize signals received from other sources, such as position sensor(s) <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Control system <b>108</b> includes control logic <b>140</b>, and can include other items <b>142</b> as well. As illustrated by the dashed box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, control system <b>108</b> can include some or all of plant evaluation system <b>126</b>, which is discussed in further detail below. Also, machine <b>102</b> can include some or all of image capture system <b>124</b>. Control logic <b>140</b> is configured to generate control signals to control sensors <b>120</b>, controllable subsystems <b>122</b>, communication system <b>112</b>, or any other items in architecture <b>100</b>. Controllable subsystems <b>122</b> include a pre-emergence weed mitigation system <b>144</b>, machine actuators <b>146</b>, a propulsion subsystem <b>148</b>, a steering subsystem <b>150</b>, and can include other items <b>152</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Machine <b>102</b> includes a data store <b>161</b> configured to store data for use by machine <b>102</b>, such as field data. Examples include, but are not limited to, field location data that identifies a location of the field to be operated upon by a machine <b>102</b>, field shape and topography data that defines a shape and topography of the field, crop location data that is indicative of a location of crops in the field (e.g., the location of crop rows), or any other data. In the illustrated example, data store <b>161</b> stores weed maps <b>162</b> that are generated by machine <b>102</b> or otherwise obtained by machine <b>102</b>, such as from plant evaluation system <b>126</b>. Of course, data store <b>161</b> can store other data as well.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Machine <b>102</b> is illustrated as including one or more processors or servers <b>163</b>, and it can include other items <b>164</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated by the dashed boxes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, machine <b>102</b> can include some or all components of image capture system <b>124</b> and/or plant evaluation system <b>126</b>, both of which are discussed in further detail below. Also, agricultural machine(s) <b>117</b> can include a pre-emergence weed mitigation system <b>119</b>, which can be similar to, or different from, system <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Image capture system <b>124</b> includes image capture components configured to capture one or more images of the area under consideration (i.e., the portions of the field to be operated upon by machine <b>102</b>) and image processing components configured to process those images. The captured images represent a spectral response captured by image capture system <b>124</b> that are provided to plant evaluations system <b>126</b> and/or stored in data store <b>174</b>. A spectral imaging system illustratively includes a camera that takes spectral images of the field under analysis. For instance, the camera can be a multispectral camera or a hyperspectral camera, or a wide variety of other devices for capturing spectral images. The camera can detect visible light, infrared radiation, or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example, the image capture components include a stereo camera configured to capture a still image, a time series of images, and/or a video of the field. An example stereo camera captures high definition video at thirty frames per second (FPS) with one hundred and ten degree wide-angle field of view. Of course, this is for sake of example only.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Illustratively, a stereo camera includes two or more lenses with a separate image sensor for each lens. Stereo images (e.g., stereoscopic photos) captured by a stereo camera allow for computer stereo vision that extracts three-dimensional information from the digital images. In another example, a single lens camera can be utilized to acquire images (referred to as a &#x201c;mono&#x201d; image).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Image capture system <b>124</b> can include one or more of an aerial image capture system <b>176</b>, an on-board image capture system <b>178</b>, and/or other image capture system <b>180</b>. An example of aerial image capture system <b>124</b> includes a camera or other imaging component carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone (e.g., block <b>115</b>). An example of on-board image capture system <b>178</b> includes a camera or other imaging component mounted on, or otherwise carried by, machine <b>102</b> (or <b>104</b>). An example of image capture system <b>180</b> includes a satellite imaging system. System <b>124</b> also includes a location system <b>182</b>, and can include other items <b>184</b> as well. Location system <b>182</b> is configured to generate a signal indicative of geographic location associated with the captured image. For example, location system <b>182</b> can output GPS coordinates that are associated with the captured image to obtain geo-referenced images <b>186</b> that are provided to plant evaluation system <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Plant evaluation system <b>126</b> illustratively includes one or more processors <b>188</b>, a communication system <b>189</b>, a data store <b>190</b>, an image analysis system <b>191</b>, target field identification logic <b>192</b>, trigger detection logic <b>193</b>, a weed map generator <b>194</b>, and can include other items <b>195</b> as well. Communication system <b>189</b>, in one example, is substantially similar to communication system <b>112</b>, discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Target field identification logic <b>192</b> is configured to identify a target or subject field for which a weed map is to be generated by weed map generator <b>194</b>. The target field identification is correlated to the weed maps <b>196</b>, which are generated by weed map generator <b>194</b> and can be stored in data store <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Trigger detection logic <b>193</b> is configured to detect a triggering criterion that triggers generation (or updating) of a weed map by generator <b>194</b>. For example, in response to detection of a triggering criteria, logic <b>193</b> can communication instructions to image capture system <b>124</b> to capture images of the target field. These images are then processed by image analysis system <b>191</b>, and the results of the image analysis are utilized by weed map generator <b>194</b> to generate weed maps <b>196</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram <b>200</b> illustrating an example operation of architecture <b>100</b> in identifying weed seed locations and performing a pre-emergence weed mitigation operation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At block <b>202</b>, logic <b>192</b> identifies a target worksite (i.e., a field to be harvested). At block <b>204</b>, logic <b>193</b> detects a trigger for triggering generation (or updating) of a weed map for the identified field. For instance, this can be done periodically (block <b>206</b>), in response to an event (block <b>208</b>), and/or manually in response to a user input (block <b>210</b>). Of course, the trigger can be detected in other ways as well. This is represented by block <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block <b>214</b>, a weed map of the field is generated. It is noted that the weed map can be generated at any of a variety of different times. For example, the weed map can be generated during the growing season, before harvest while the crops (and weeds) are growing. This is represented by block <b>216</b>. In another example, the weed map can be generated at harvest time, when a harvesting machine is performing a harvesting operation in the field. This is represented by block <b>218</b>. In another example, the weed map can be generated by a combination of inputs during the growing season and at harvest time. This is represented by block <b>220</b>. Of course, the weed map can be generated in other ways as well. This is represented by block <b>222</b>. In one example, the weed map can include two (or more) plant classifications, i.e., crop and weed. Alternatively, or in addition, the weed map can include multiple non-crop plant classifications based on, for example but not by limitation, species, size, maturity, vigor, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one example, image capture system <b>124</b> captures spectral images of the field under analysis, as well as video images. Geographic location information is associated with those images, and they are provided to plant evaluation system <b>126</b>. System <b>126</b> identifies evaluation zones in the field under analysis and analyzes the spectral images received from system <b>124</b> to identify weed plants in the evaluation zones. This can be done in any of a number of ways. For instance, the images can be processed to identify areas that correspond to weed plants. In another example, system <b>126</b> can identify areas in the evaluation zones that represent crop plants and subtract those areas out of the images to obtain a remaining image portion that represents the weeds or non-crop plants.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, the image capture system includes a camera, such as a multispectral camera or a hyperspectral camera, or a wide variety of other devices for capturing images. A video imaging system can be utilized that includes a camera that captures images in the visible or thermal image range. For example, it can be a visible light video camera with a wide angle lens, or a wide variety of other video imaging systems.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, plant density information can be generated and associated with the weed map. That is, in addition to the weed map identifying areas of the field that contain weeds, a density metric can be associated with those areas. For instance, the density metric can indicate a percentage of the plants within the area that are weed plants versus crop plants. In another instance, it can be weeds / unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one example, image analysis system <b>191</b> includes spectral analysis logic that performs spectral analysis to evaluate the plants in the images. In one example, this includes identifying areas in the image that have a spectral signature that corresponds to ground versus plants. For instance, this can be a green/brown comparison. Image segmentation logic can perform image segmentation to segment or divide the image into different portions for processing. This can be based on ground and/or plant area identifications by ground/plant identification logic, and crop classification performed by crop classification logic. Briefly, this can identify areas of an image that represent ground and areas of an image that represent plants, for example using the spatial and spectral analysis. Crop classification logic can use a crop classifier, that is trained using crop training data, to identify areas in the image that represent crop plants and/or areas that represent weed plants.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition to identifying the location of the plant relative to the surface plane of the field (e.g., x/y coordinates), a height of the weed plants can be identified (e.g., how high the plant rises from the terrain in the z direction).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At block <b>224</b>, weed seed locations are identified. The weed seed locations identify the location of the weed seeds pre-emergence, that is before the seeds germinate and emerge as visible plants. The weed seed locations can be identified in any of a number of ways. For example, the weed seed locations can be identified based on a priori data (block <b>226</b>), in situ data (block <b>228</b>), or a combination of a priori and in situ data (block <b>230</b>). For instance, the weed seed locations can be based on an a priori weed map generated during the growing season at block <b>216</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, the weed seed locations can be identified based on in situ data collected by on-board sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated at block <b>232</b>, the identified weed seed locations can be utilized to generate a weed seed map that maps the locations of the weed seeds to the field under analysis. An example weed seed map identifies regions of the field that are determined to have a number of weed seeds above a threshold, which can be defined in any of a number of ways. For example, the threshold can be pre-defined, set by an operator, dynamically determined, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated at block <b>234</b>, the weed seed locations are identified based on the weed map, generated at block <b>294</b>, which maps locations of the weeds in the field, taking into account a weed seed movement model. This model projects the likely location of a weed plant&#x2019;s seeds given the location of that weed plant and external factors that affect movement of the seed from the weed plant location. For instance, the model can take into account weather or other environmental data. For instance, the location of the weed seeds on the field can be determined based on the direction and/or speed of the wind as detected by sensors on machine <b>102</b> or otherwise obtained from a remote weather data source. In another example, the weed seed model can identify terrain conditions, such as slope or topography, precipitation, among other factors which can contribute to the displacement of the seeds from a weed plant.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively, or in addition, the weed seed movement model can model machine data that processes the weed plants. For example, in the case of an agricultural harvesting machine, the machine data can be utilized to compensate for machine delays caused by the processing through the combine. That is, the machine delay models the distance (with respect to the field surface) between when the weed plant is cut by the header of the combine and the weed seeds are discharged by a chaff spreader. This delay can be dynamically determined based on machine settings (header speed, thresher settings, chaff settings, etc.) that may vary the time that it takes for the seed to travel through the combine and be discharged onto the field. As used herein, chaff refers to any material (also referred to a &#x201c;residue&#x201d;) that is ejected from the harvesting machine (typically from the rear of the machine), even though it may contain some crop material. That is, during operation of the combine, it is often the case that some crop material ends up in the non-crop material flow, and vice versa. Of course, the weed seed locations can be identified in other ways as well. This is represented by block <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>238</b>, the current weed seed locations (e.g., the weed seed map generated at block <b>232</b>) is stored. The weed seed locations can be stored locally (e.g., in data store <b>161</b>), can be sent to another agricultural machine (e.g., machine <b>117</b>), and/or can be sent to a remote computing system (e.g., system <b>114</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>240</b>, a control signal is generated for a pre-emergence weed mitigation operation. This can be performed during and/or after a harvesting operation. For example, a mitigation operation performed during the harvesting operation comprises a selective harvest. This is represented by block <b>242</b>. For instance, the harvesting machine can be controlled to selectively harvest different areas of the field based on the weed seed locations. That is, an area of high weed seed occurrence can be ignored, and then mitigated after the harvesting operation. In another example, the harvesting operation can selectively harvest areas of high weed seed presence in a single harvesting operation (so all of the material is collected together in the material repository) and then can be subsequently processed. These, of course, are for sake of example only.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another example, the weed seeds are collecting during the harvesting operation. For instance, a collector or other apparatus is positioned to collect the discharge from the combine and prevent the weed seeds from being ejected back onto the field. Alternatively, or in addition, a mitigator can be utilized to destroy or otherwise devitalize the weed seeds, inhibiting further germination or promulgation of the weed seeds. This can include mechanical mitigators, chemical mitigators, irradiation mitigators, etc. Examples of this are discussed in further detail below. Briefly, however, an example mitigator (mechanical, chemical, or otherwise) includes a device that interacts with the weed seed such that the weed seed has a lower ability to promulgate or germinate in a subsequent growing season.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also, the pre-emergence weed mitigation operation can discourage growth of the weed seeds. This is represented by block <b>248</b>. For example, a tiller machine can be utilized to till the area, post-harvest, to bury the weed seeds at a threshold depth (e.g., twelve inches or greater) at which the weed seeds are unlikely to germinate. In another example, early germination of the weed seeds can be stimulated (i.e., during the fall) so that the germinated weeds are exposed to the cold fall/winter weather which is likely to destroy the weed plants. In another example, a chemical can be applied to the weed seeds to discourage their spring germination and/or increase predation (e.g., being consumed by predator animals).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Of course, the pre-emergence weed mitigation operation can comprise other types of operations as well. This is represented by block <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram <b>300</b> illustrating an example operation for generating weed map(s). For sake of illustration, but not by limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> will be described in the context of systems <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> generating weed maps <b>196</b> for use by machine <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A block <b>302</b>, image data of the field is collected during the growing season and/or at harvest. As discussed above, this can include multispectral and/or hyperspectral images, represented by block <b>304</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, closeup video of the plants can be obtained at block <b>306</b>. Of course, other images can be obtained as well. This is represented by block 308.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also, the image data can be collected from a wide variety of different sources, for example, the image data can be collected from a UAV (block <b>310</b>), a satellite system (block <b>312</b>), on-board cameras (block <b>314</b>) that are on board machine <b>102</b>, and/or from other machines or devices (block <b>316</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A physiological plant growth model can be obtained at block <b>318</b>. Illustratively, a plant growth model can be used to understand what weed/crop maturity stage(s) to expect at a given time and location in the field. This can facilitate improvement of classifier results, especially if the characteristics change significantly during the growth cycle (i.e. less misclassification, better ability to differentiate). The model can represent irrigation patterns of the field (block <b>320</b>), weather data (block <b>322</b>), and/or soil/terrain data (block <b>324</b>). The weather data at block <b>322</b> can represent precipitation during the growing season and the soil/terrain data <b>324</b> can indicate soil characteristics, such as moisture, etc., as well as terrain topology data, such as the slope of the field.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Also, the plant growth model can be generated based on data from a farm management information system (FMIS). This is represented by block <b>326</b>. An example FMIS system provides information on the type and/or variety of the planted crop, plant date of the crop, treatments that have been applied to the crop (e.g., before or during the growing season). Of course, the model can be obtained using other data as well. This is represented by block <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At block <b>330</b>, crop characteristics are obtained. In one example, this models where the crop maturity should be given the growth model. For instance, the crop characteristics obtained at block <b>330</b> can indicate that the crop and/or weeds should be at a particular emergence stage. In one example, this can represent crop/weed dry up characteristics prior to harvest. This can be utilized to differentiate crops and weeds, and is represented by block <b>332</b>. In another example, relative maturity rate data can be obtained at block <b>334</b>. In one example, this is utilized to find zones of similar agronomic behavior that can be utilized to classify weeds versus crops in smaller areas of the field, rather than across the entire field collectively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Of course, other crop characteristics can be obtained as well. This is represented by block <b>336</b>. At block <b>338</b>, the images collected at block <b>332</b> are classified to obtain a georeferenced weed map. For example, the classification can utilize a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In one example, a crop mask is applied on the NDVI to obtain better crop development monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another example, weed/crop identifying characteristics can include reflectance spectra (block <b>342</b>), leaf shape information (block <b>344</b>), population texture (block <b>346</b>), plant height (block <b>348</b>), etc. Of course, the images can be classified in other ways as well. This is represented by block <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At block <b>352</b>, the weed map is output. For example, the weed map can be output to control system <b>108</b> for use by weed seed mapping system <b>109</b> to control pre-emergence weed mitigation system <b>144</b>. In another example, the weed map can be output for storage and/or display to remote user <b>118</b> and/or operator <b>130</b> using a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As noted above, one example of agricultural machine <b>102</b> is a harvester or combine, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> which is a partial pictorial, partial schematic, illustration of an agricultural harvesting machine <b>400</b> (or combine). It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that combine <b>400</b> illustratively includes an operator compartment <b>401</b>, which can have a variety of different operator interface mechanisms, for controlling combine <b>400</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below. Combine <b>400</b> can include a set of front end equipment that can include header <b>402</b>, and a cutter generally indicated at <b>404</b>. It can also include a feeder house <b>406</b>, a feed accelerator <b>408</b>, and a thresher generally indicated at <b>410</b>. Thresher <b>410</b> illustratively includes a threshing rotor <b>412</b> and a set of concaves <b>414</b>. Further, combine <b>400</b> can include a separator <b>416</b> that includes a separator rotor. Combine <b>400</b> can include a cleaning subsystem (or cleaning shoe) <b>418</b> that, itself, can include a cleaning fan <b>420</b>, chaffer <b>422</b> and sieve <b>424</b>. The material handling subsystem in combine <b>400</b> can include (in addition to a feeder house <b>406</b> and feed accelerator <b>408</b>) discharge beater <b>426</b>, tailings elevator <b>428</b>, clean grain elevator <b>430</b> (that moves clean grain into clean grain tank <b>432</b>) as well as unloading auger <b>434</b> and spout <b>436</b>. Combine <b>400</b> can further include a residue subsystem <b>438</b> that can include chopper <b>440</b> and spreader <b>442</b>. Combine <b>400</b> can also have a propulsion subsystem that includes an engine that drives ground engaging wheels <b>444</b> or tracks, etc. It will be noted that combine <b>400</b> may also have more than one of any of the subsystems mentioned above (such as left and right cleaning shoes, separators, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In operation, and by way of overview, combine <b>400</b> illustratively moves through a field in the direction indicated by arrow <b>446</b>. As it moves, header <b>402</b> engages the crop to be harvested and gathers it toward cutter <b>404</b>. After it is cut, it is moved through a conveyor in feeder house <b>406</b> toward feed accelerator <b>408</b>, which accelerates the crop into thresher <b>410</b>. The crop is threshed by rotor <b>412</b> rotating the crop against concave <b>414</b>. The threshed crop is moved by a separator rotor in separator <b>416</b> where some of the residue is moved by discharge beater <b>426</b> toward the residue subsystem <b>438</b>. It can be chopped by residue chopper <b>440</b> and spread on the field by spreader <b>442</b>. In other implementations, the residue is simply dropped in a windrow, instead of being chopped and spread.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Grain falls to cleaning shoe (or cleaning subsystem) <b>418</b>. Chaffer <b>422</b> separates some of the larger material from the grain, and sieve <b>424</b> separates some of the finer material from the clean grain. Clean grain falls to an auger in clean grain elevator <b>430</b>, which moves the clean grain upward and deposits it in clean grain tank <b>432</b>. Residue can be removed from the cleaning shoe <b>418</b> by airflow generated by cleaning fan <b>420</b>. That residue can also be moved rearwardly in combine <b>400</b> toward the residue handling subsystem <b>438</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Tailings can be moved by tailings elevator <b>428</b> back to thresher <b>410</b> where they can be re-threshed. Alternatively, the tailings can also be passed to a separate re-threshing mechanism (also using a tailings elevator or another transport mechanism) where they can be re-threshed as well.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> also shows that, in one example, combine <b>400</b> can include ground speed sensor <b>447</b>, one or more separator loss sensors <b>448</b>, a clean grain camera <b>450</b>, one or more cleaning shoe loss sensors <b>452</b>, forward looking camera <b>454</b>, rearward looking camera <b>456</b>, a tailings elevator camera <b>458</b>, and a wide variety of other cameras or image/video capture devices. Ground speed sensor <b>446</b> illustratively senses the travel speed of combine <b>400</b> over the ground. This can be done by sensing the speed of rotation of the wheels, the drive shaft, the axel, or other components. The travel speed can also be sensed by a positioning system, such as a global positioning system (GPS), a dead reckoning system, a LORAN system, or a wide variety of other systems or sensors that provide an indication of travel speed. In one example, optical sensor(s) capture images and optical flow is utilized to determine relative movement between two (or more) images taken at a given time spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Cleaning shoe loss sensors <b>452</b> illustratively provide an output signal indicative of the quantity of grain loss. In one example, this includes signal(s) indicative of the quality of grain loss by both the right and left sides of the cleaning shoe <b>418</b>. In one example, sensors <b>452</b> are strike sensors which count grain strikes per unit of time (or per unit of distance traveled) to provide an indication of the cleaning shoe grain loss. The strike sensors for the right and left sides of the cleaning shoe can provide individual signals, or a combined or aggregated signal. In one example, sound-based sensors across an area of the cleaning shoe and/or rotor can be utilized to obtain a count of grain strikes and a spatial distribution associated with the count. It will be noted that sensors <b>452</b> can comprise only a single sensor as well, instead of separate sensors for each shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Separator loss sensor <b>448</b> provides a signal indicative of grain loss in the left and right separators. The sensors associated with the left and right separators can provide separate grain loss signals or a combined or aggregate signal. This can be done using a wide variety of different types of sensors as well. It will be noted that separator loss sensors <b>448</b> may also comprise only a single sensor, instead of separate left and right sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Cameras <b>450</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> and <b>458</b> illustratively capture video or still images that can be transmitted to, and displayed on, a display in operator compartment <b>401</b> or a remote device (shown in more detail below) in near real time. Clean grain camera <b>450</b>, for instance, generates a video feed showing grain passing into clean grain tank <b>432</b> (or through clean grain elevator <b>430</b>). Camera <b>454</b> can illustratively generate a video feed showing a view forward of operator compartment <b>401</b>, such as showing header <b>402</b> and/or the crop in front of header <b>402</b>. Cameras <b>456</b> and <b>458</b> illustratively generate a video feed showing the tailings in elevator <b>458</b> and the discharge beater <b>442</b> and an area of the field behind combine <b>400</b>, respectively. Alternatively, or in addition to a video feed, captured images can be augmented and presented to the operator, for example in a manner aimed to reduce cognitive load on the operation. These are examples only, and additional or different cameras can be used and/or they can be devices that capture still images or other visual data.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram showing one example of machine <b>400</b> deployed in architecture <b>100</b>. As illustrated, combine <b>400</b> is configured to communicate over network <b>116</b> with remote computing system(s) <b>114</b>, as well as a set of assistive machines <b>502</b>, which can include a chaff collector <b>504</b>, a grain cart <b>506</b>, a tiller <b>508</b>, and/or other machines <b>510</b>.

When control system <b>540</b> or other items on machine <b>400</b> use speech recognition, and/or speech synthesis, then user interface mechanisms <b>528</b> can include a microphone, a speaker, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating one example of control system <b>540</b>.

The burier follows the chaff ejection components which can either spread the chaff on the ground, drop the chaff in a windrow, or otherwise. The buriers operate to bury the ejected chaff, and thus the weed seeds, to a threshold depth in the ground (e.g., twelve inches or deeper) which inhibits germination of the weed seeds. Also, it is noted that a burier can comprise a separate machine that follows combine <b>400</b>. Seed mitigators <b>702</b> can include other types of mitigators as well. This is represented by block <b>718</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">System <b>570</b> is also illustrated as including communication/control logic <b>720</b> configured to communicate with other items in combine <b>400</b> and/or generate control signals to control weed seed mitigators <b>702</b>. Of course, system <b>570</b> can include other items <b>722</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> (collectively referred to as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) is a flow diagram <b>800</b> illustrating an example operation to generate weed seed locations and perform pre-emergent mitigation during a harvesting operation. For sake of illustration, but not by limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> will be described in the context of combine <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">At block <b>801</b>, a prior generated weed map of the target field (if any) is obtained. For example, this can include receiving weed map <b>618</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. At block <b>802</b>, a location and/or heading/path of combine <b>400</b> is obtained. For instance, this can be based on the sensor signals <b>620</b> which illustrate a current position and direction of combine <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At block <b>803</b>, images of plants in the path of combine <b>400</b> (e.g., forthcoming plants that are expected to reach the crop processing functionality of the combine) are obtained. For instance, this can include mono images (block <b>804</b>), stereo images (block <b>805</b>), or other images (block <b>806</b>). For example, the images obtained at block <b>803</b> can be received as images <b>626</b> from image capture system <b>124</b> that is on-board combine <b>400</b> and/or carried on a separate machine, such as UAV that operates ahead of combine <b>400</b> in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">At block <b>807</b>, image classification is performed on the images obtained at block <b>803</b>. Examples of image classification are discussed above. Briefly, however, the image classification performed at block <b>807</b> classifies areas of the image as representing weed plants, crop plants, etc. Based on this, a weed map is obtained at block <b>808</b>. As represented at block <b>809</b>, the weed map can include the generation of a new weed map and/or the modification of an existing map. For example, the image classification performed at block <b>807</b> can be utilized to modify the weed map obtained at block <b>801</b>. The weed map can be obtained in other ways as well. This is represented at block <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At block <b>811</b>, weed areas are identified based on the weed map obtained at block <b>808</b>. The identified weed areas can include a spatial boundary that identifies its relative position on the field, as well as weed density information that identifies the density of the weeds within the weed area.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">At block <b>812</b>, each weed area is correlated to positions of the machine when the header 102 is within the weed area (i.e., when the header is actively cutting within the weed area).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For sake of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example weed area <b>813</b> on a field <b>814</b> being harvested by combine <b>400</b>. The correlation at block <b>812</b> identifies the position of combine <b>400</b> when the header first reaches the beginning edge <b>815</b> of weed area <b>813</b> until the header passes the trailing edge <b>816</b>. A treatment zone is defined between edges <b>815</b> and <b>816</b> (and corresponding to the width of the header). Thus, for machine positions in which the header is within the treatment zone, the header is cutting the weed area, and is thus gathering weed seeds along with crop plants from that area of the field.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As also shown, mitigation system <b>570</b> follows combine <b>400</b> (e.g., is attached to the combine <b>400</b>, is pulled by combine <b>400</b>, is pulled/carried by a separate machine, etc.) and is configured to perform a weed seed mitigation operation. For example, system <b>570</b> can include a trailer or container that is configured to collect the chaff or residue ejected from the rear of combine <b>400</b>, bury the chaff, burn the chaff, chemically treat the chaff, etc. In one example, a bagger collects the chaff into bags that are deposited or dropped on the field and later collected. System <b>570</b> can tag (e.g., with markings, barcodes, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, the bags with information on the collected chaff (e.g., location, type of material, quantity, weed seed composition, etc.). This information can be read from the tags during subsequent processing.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, at block <b>817</b>, weed seed movement through the combine is determined. As discussed above, this, in one example, is based on machine delay compensation that represents the amount of time that it takes the weed seeds to move from a given point in the combine (e.g., the header cutting in the treatment zone) to a weed seed mitigator (e.g., collector, crusher, burner, etc.). This machine delay compensation is utilized by control system <b>540</b> to determine when to activate the corresponding mitigator to minimize operation of the mitigator. In other words, this operates to prevent or at least reduce operation of the mitigator during times when the mitigator is receiving material that does not include weed seeds or has weed seeds below a threshold. Thus, the mitigator is activated based on the spatial location of mitigator relative to the weed seed area. This can operate to reduce the associated costs of operating the mitigator. That is, some mitigators, such as seed crushers, have high operating costs in terms of power consumption, reduced efficiencies, wear and tear on the components, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one example, the weed movement within combine <b>400</b> is estimated, for example based on the machine operation model and/or current settings (e.g., settings of thresher <b>556</b>, cleaner <b>558</b>, chaff processing <b>560</b>, etc.). This is represented by block <b>818</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, weed seed movement can be detected based on signals received from on-board sensors. This is represented by block <b>819</b>. For example, on-board sensors such as electromagnetic sensors (block <b>820</b>), capacitive sensors (block <b>821</b>), impact sensors (block <b>822</b>), or other types of sensors (block <b>823</b>) can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some examples, chaff material such as leaves, stalks, or other residue material are typically less dense than weed seeds and have lower concentrations of protein and/or oil. Leaves and stalks are typically composed of only carbohydrates, and possibly a small amount of chlorophyll and water. This information can be leveraged from the signals received from on-board sensors <b>819</b> to determine the presence of weed seeds in the material flow.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> (collectively referred to as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), an example image <b>1000</b> is received from an electromagnetic sensor that uses electromagnetic radiation that is reflected, scattered, transmitted, or absorbed by components of the material flow. In one example, image <b>1000</b> includes a grayscale image of the electromagnetic transmission through a material flow <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Due to their differences in composition (e.g., as noted above, seeds typically have higher concentrations of oil and protein), chaff and seeds can have different electromagnetic responses that can be detected and utilized to identify weed seeds in material flow <b>1002</b>. Because seeds are denser than chaff, they show up darker in image <b>1000</b>. Similarly, size can be determined from the image and/or attenuation of the electromagnetic source signal (e.g., darker portions of the image can represent thicker material).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows image <b>1000</b> after gray objects have been classified as soybean seed (identified by reference numeral <b>1006</b>). Similarly, palmer amaranth is identified at reference numeral <b>1008</b> and common ragweed seed is identified at reference numeral <b>1010</b> using shape and size information. In one example, texture as well as non-visible spectra is utilized to determine density and/or reflectance difference. Alternatively, or in addition, active (modulated/pulsed) illumination is reposed in different spectral bands. In one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, chaff material represented at reference numeral <b>1012</b> is ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It is noted that any type of classifier can be utilized for classifying the material in material flow <b>1002</b>. For example, a rules-based classifier can classify weed seeds based on size, shape, and/or color. In another example, a neural network can be trained to identify seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, at block <b>826</b> weed seed mapping system <b>606</b> determines a concentration of weed seed within the plant material. That is, one example, block <b>826</b> determines the ratio of crops to weeds within the harvested material. At block <b>827</b>, control logic <b>610</b> can control user interface mechanism <b>642</b> to output an indication of the weed seed processing to operator <b>130</b>. For instance, an augmented view of the weed seed can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">At block <b>828</b>, one or more weed seed mitigators are controlled by control logic <b>610</b> generating control signals <b>638</b> to weed mitigation system <b>570</b>. As noted above, this can include any of a wide variety of operations performed by combine <b>400</b>. For example, the chaff treatment system can be controlled at block <b>829</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, a seed crusher is controlled at block <b>830</b>, a seed burner is controlled at block <b>831</b>, a seed collector/bagger is controlled at block <b>832</b>, a seed burier is controlled at block <b>833</b>, and/or chaff discharge can be controlled at block 834.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, the chaff discharge <b>834</b> can be switched from a spreading mode to a windrowing mode. For instance, when high concentrations of weed seeds are about to be discharged from combine <b>400</b>, the discharge settings can be set to place the material in a windrow for subsequent burning, burying, and/or pickup (by combine <b>400</b> or another machine).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Of course, other types of weed seed mitigators can be controlled as well. This is represented by block <b>835</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one example, the control at block <b>828</b> includes adjusting header <b>402</b> of combine <b>400</b>. This is represented at block <b>836</b>. For example, in response to detecting the presence of weed plants in the path of the header, header <b>402</b> can be lowered to ensure that the crops are cut and processed through combine <b>400</b>, so their seeds do not remain on the field. Alternatively, header <b>402</b> can be raised so that the weed area is not harvested. The weed area can be treated on-site (e.g., mechanically) to minimize weed seed spread.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In another example, the thresher settings can be adjusted at block <b>837</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, the machine speed can be adjusted at block <b>838</b>. For example, it may be that seed crusher <b>830</b> performs better at lower machine speeds. Thus, the machine can be controlled to a desired speed during operation of the weed seed mitigator.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Also, it is noted that the control at block <b>828</b> can be automatic, for example based on weed seed concentration thresholds. This is represented at block <b>839</b>. For example, the weed seed concentration determined at block <b>826</b> can be compared against one or more thresholds and, if a particular threshold is met, one of weed seed mitigators <b>702</b> can be activated. Alternatively, or in addition, the control at block <b>828</b> can be manual, for example based on operator input. This is represented by block <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">At block <b>842</b>, the weed seed locations in the field are generated. For example, the weed seed locations can be generated based on one or more factors that affect the movement of the weed seeds once they are released from combine <b>400</b>. For instance, this can be based on the machine speed, location and/or orientation when released. This is represented by block <b>844</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, the locations of the weed seed can be determined based on environmental factors, such as air density, wind, rain, surface water, surface topology, etc. This is represented at block <b>846</b>. Also, the weed seed locations can be generated based on chaff spreader data (e.g., data <b>634</b>). This is represented at block <b>847</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The weed seed locations generated at block <b>842</b> can be stored on-board combine <b>400</b> (block <b>848</b>) in data store <b>534</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, the weed seed locations can be sent to a remote system, such as system <b>114</b>, other agricultural machines <b>117</b>, and/or another machine/system (block <b>849</b>). Of course, the weed seed locations can be generated and utilized in other ways as well. This is represented by block <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">At block <b>852</b>, other machines are controlled to perform pre-emergent field operations based on the weed seed locations. For instance, a tilling machine can be controlled to perform a tilling operation in treatment areas of the field that correspond to the weed seed locations. This is represented by block <b>853</b>. In another example, a chemical application machine (e.g., a sprayer) is controlled to chemically treat the weed seed locations to destroy the seeds, stimulate early germination, etc. This is represented by block <b>854</b>. In another example, at block <b>855</b>, predation can be enhanced by an application of a substance to the weed seeds. In another example, selective planting can be performed in the next growing season. This is represented by block <b>856</b>. For instance, different crop planting prescriptions can be utilized based on the identification of weed seed areas in the field and/or their corresponding weed seed densities.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In another example, operation of a grain processor can be controlled based on the crop/weed ratio. This is represented by block <b>857</b>. For example, when a grain cart is filled by combine <b>400</b>, the weed seed concentration information determined at block <b>826</b> can be utilized to determine a subsequent grain processing operation to remove the weed seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Of course, pre-emergent operations can be performed in other ways as well. This is represented by block <b>858</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As noted above, in some examples weed plants include a second crop intercropped with a first crop and undergoing simultaneous harvest. In accordance with one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the weed areas identified at block <b>811</b> (e.g., based on the prior-generated weed map obtained at block <b>801</b>, the weed map obtained at block <b>808</b>, etc.) identify areas of the field that contain the second crop. For instance, the weed seed locations <b>640</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) represent second crop locations and can include as-planted maps, crop maps from aerial images, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, the operations controlled at blocks <b>828</b> and/or <b>852</b> can be configured to nondestructively collect and segregate the second crop (&#x201c;the weed&#x201d;) from the first crop. For sake of illustration, at block <b>832</b> a seed collector/bagger is configured to segregate and collect the second crop. In another example, adjustments can be made (e.g., blocks <b>836</b>, <b>837</b>, etc.) to collect and keep both crops together for later separation with minimal (or at least reduced) harvest losses in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one example, the seed collector/bagger is equipped with a crop sensor for measuring the yield or other attributes (e.g., moisture, oil, protein, starch, etc.) of the second crop. These yield and crop attribute measurements can be displayed to an operator (in place of or in addition to the those of the first crop), georeferenced and stored on a map, and/or used for machine control.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It can thus be seen that the present system provides a number of advantages. For example, but not by limitation, the present system provides site-specific agricultural operations to mitigate weeds by identifying, before emergence, the locations of the weed seeds. Further, the weed seed locations can be accurately determined by taking into account machine data, environmental data, and/or any other data utilized to model weed seed movement. Using those weed seed locations, the weeds (including herbicide resistant varieties) can be mitigated. This can increase yields, while reducing the application of chemicals to the fields and/or machine operations (e.g., sprayer operation over the field to chemically treat weeds post-emergence. This, in turn, can decrease power/fuel consumption, reduced machine wear and tear, and/or otherwise increase efficiencies/productively of the agricultural operations.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It will be noted that the above discussion has described a variety of different systems, components and/or logic. It will be appreciated that such systems, components and/or logic can be comprised of hardware items (such as processors and associated memory, or other processing components, some of which are described below) that perform the functions associated with those systems, components and/or logic. In addition, the systems, components and/or logic can be comprised of software that is loaded into a memory and is subsequently executed by a processor or server, or other computing component, as described below. The systems, components and/or logic can also be comprised of different combinations of hardware, software, firmware, etc., some examples of which are described below. These are only some examples of different structures that can be used to form the systems, components and/or logic described above. Other structures can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The present discussion has mentioned processors, processing systems, controllers and/or servers. In one example, these can include computer processors with associated memory and timing circuitry, not separately shown. They are functional parts of the systems or devices to which they belong and are activated by, and facilitate the functionality of the other components or items in those systems.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Also, a number of user interface displays have been discussed. They can take a wide variety of different forms and can have a wide variety of different user actuatable input mechanisms disposed thereon. For instance, the user actuatable input mechanisms can be text boxes, check boxes, icons, links, drop-down menus, search boxes, etc. They can also be actuated in a wide variety of different ways. For instance, they can be actuated using a point and click device (such as a track ball or mouse). They can be actuated using hardware buttons, switches, a joystick or keyboard, thumb switches or thumb pads, etc. They can also be actuated using a virtual keyboard or other virtual actuators. In addition, where the screen on which they are displayed is a touch sensitive screen, they can be actuated using touch gestures. Also, where the device that displays them has speech recognition components, they can be actuated using speech commands.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">A number of data stores have also been discussed. It will be noted they can each be broken into multiple data stores. All can be local to the systems accessing them, all can be remote, or some can be local while others are remote. All of these configurations are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Also, the figures show a number of blocks with functionality ascribed to each block. It will be noted that fewer blocks can be used so the functionality is performed by fewer components. Also, more blocks can be used with the functionality distributed among more components.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a block diagram of one example of the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, where machine <b>400</b> communicates with elements in a remote server architecture <b>900</b>. In an example, remote server architecture <b>900</b> can provide computation, software, data access, and storage services that do not require end-user knowledge of the physical location or configuration of the system that delivers the services. In various examples, remote servers can deliver the services over a wide area network, such as the internet, using appropriate protocols. For instance, remote servers can deliver applications over a wide area network and they can be accessed through a web browser or any other computing component. Software or components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as well as the corresponding data, can be stored on servers at a remote location. The computing resources in a remote server environment can be consolidated at a remote data center location or they can be dispersed. Remote server infrastructures can deliver services through shared data centers, even though they appear as a single point of access for the user. Thus, the components and functions described herein can be provided from a remote server at a remote location using a remote server architecture. Alternatively, they can be provided from a conventional server, or they can be installed on client devices directly, or in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, some items are similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and they are similarly numbered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> specifically shows that system <b>124</b>, system <b>126</b>, system <b>540</b>, and/or data store <b>534</b> can be located at a remote server location <b>902</b>. Therefore, agricultural machine <b>400</b>, machine(s) <b>115</b>, machine(s) <b>117</b>, and/or system(s) <b>114</b> access those systems through remote server location <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> also depicts another example of a remote server architecture. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows that it is also contemplated that some elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are disposed at remote server location <b>902</b> while others are not. By way of example, data store <b>534</b> can be disposed at a location separate from location <b>902</b>, and accessed through the remote server at location <b>902</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more of systems <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>540</b> can be disposed at location(s) separate from location <b>902</b>, and accessed through the remote server at location <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Regardless of where they are located, they can be accessed directly by agricultural machine <b>400</b>, through a network (either a wide area network or a local area network), they can be hosted at a remote site by a service, or they can be provided as a service, or accessed by a connection service that resides in a remote location. Also, the data can be stored in substantially any location and intermittently accessed by, or forwarded to, interested parties. For instance, physical carriers can be used instead of, or in addition to, electromagnetic wave carriers. In such an example, where cell coverage is poor or nonexistent, another mobile machine (such as a fuel truck) can have an automated information collection system. As the agricultural machine comes close to the fuel truck for fueling, the system automatically collects the information from the machine or transfers information to the machine using any type of ad-hoc wireless connection. The collected information can then be forwarded to the main network as the fuel truck reaches a location where there is cellular coverage (or other wireless coverage). For instance, the fuel truck may enter a covered location when traveling to fuel other machines or when at a main fuel storage location. All of these architectures are contemplated herein. Further, the information can be stored on the agricultural machine until the agricultural machine enters a covered location. The agricultural machine, itself, can then send and receive the information to/from the main network.</p>
