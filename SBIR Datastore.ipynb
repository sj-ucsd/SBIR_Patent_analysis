The technology developed in this project seeks to address these issues to create a truly seamless and immersive interaction experience for users. The technology may also improve the adoption of augmented/virtual reality technologies in fields such as education, telecommuting, healthcare, industrial design, virtual meetings, entertainment, and many others. The technology has the potential to create new jobs in these fields, enhance human-to-machine interactions, and improve connections within and between communities.

Amelioration of miniature embedded computing devices into the consumer and industrial markets with enabled connectivity to the Internet towards smart and intelligent features leads to an upsurge in the size of networks through which they are linked and communicate. Unfortunately, with the massive amount of potential benefits offered by IoT devices comes an equal amount of potential vulnerabilities and cyber-threats including such as Malware, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Detection and defense of cyber-threats in IoT devices are traditionally performed by anti-virus (AV) software. However, AV-based threat detection has significant setbacks including large latency, processing overheads, inability to effectively detect zero-day attacks, and requirement of frequent updates. In this project, we propose the design of hardware-assisted runtime cyber-threat detection. We employ hardware-generated microarchitectural event traces captured through hardware performance counter (HPC) register information to extract the application characteristics to detect cyber-threats. To minimize overheads and facilitate runtime feasibility, an automated learning-based optimal feature extraction is designed. These features are fed to a lightweight machine learning (ML) classifier to detect the feasibility of the presence of cyber-threat. This is complemented with a specialized ML classifier in the second stage for enhanced performance. The second stage ML classifier also employs a time-series-based anomaly detection for zero-day and unseen threat detection.

Processes of interest for bioenergy include measuring enzyme function within cells, tracking metabolic pathways in vivo, monitoring the transport of materials into and out of cells or across cellular membranes and, measuring signaling process between cells and within plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. High-utility organic products (biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, etc.) are most effectively produced by way of industrial fermentation enabled by microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi. End-product synthesis begins with genetically engineered microbial strains with redirected metabolic paths which either increase the yield of natural metabolites or produce new molecules. Because bioprocess scale-up costs are extremely high, reliable scale-up remains an enormous technical and economic barrier for commercialization of bioprocesses. To provide insight into the metabolic process with the goal of increasing yield, single-cell NMR sensors based on nanodiamond (ND) particles with unique quantum properties are being developed. 13C nuclear spins in nanodiamond will be employed as NMR sensors of the surrounding analyte nuclei. Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei boost their NMR signal and increase the capability to measure the NMR chemical shift of potential analytes present in nearby hyperpolarized 13C nuclei.

Removing the repetitive bending over and tying actions can have significant impacts on the quality life of the workers who commonly suffer from carpal tunnel complications and back injuries. The market for rebar tying services solely for bridge decks in the US is valued at over $370 million across the next ten years.

One of the major limiting factors of these furnaces is the cooling rate. Currently, the vacuum furnace relies on radiation to dissipate heat and takes at least 2 hours to cool the furnace low enough to safely open for a sample change. This results in significant limitations of using expensive neutron beam time. To tackle this challenge, ACT proposes an innovative active cooling system to significantly reduce neutron scattering furnaces’ downtime. The system includes a closed helium (He) circulation loop, industrial-grade process control, furnace flow distribution nozzles, and a built-in refrigeration unit to achieve fast and controllable cooling. Due to the much higher thermal conductivity of the He gas compared to other inert gases (e.g., nitrogen, argon), heat can be removed from the system more effectively. By introducing the He flow inside the radiation shields via a flow distributor nozzle, the cooling rate can also be controlled by adjusting the flow rate and overall system pressure. The thermal characteristics and low neutron scattering and adsorption coefficients of He provide the potential for in- situ cooling for advanced material experiments. This will allow experimenters to perform controlled transient thermal tests that could not have been done before. The proposed active cooling system has very low He usage (closed-loop circulation) and requires a minimal human operation. During Phases I and II, a fully operational and mobile prototype cooling system was constructed and tested in the field with an operational HOT-006 neutron furnace at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The He cooling system managed to cool the heating element from 500&#176;C to 100&#176;C in just 8 minutes, a 17 times improvement compared to 2.24 hours for the original radiation-only cooling approach. The thermal stresses on the coil were evaluated, and a proof-of-concept constant cooling rate approach was demonstrated. The successful test at ORNL brings the technology to TRL (Technology Readiness Level) to 7. In Phase IIA, ACT will continue working with ORNL to refine the cooling system, extend its capabilities, and further push for the commercialization of the technology. It will be achieved by extended long-term usage tests at ORNL during mock and live neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, the capabilities of the cooling system will be extended to include rapid sample quenching and a closed-loop controlled cooling rate. The cooling system will also be validated for operation with a cheaper, lower-performance circulation gas medium (nitrogen, argon) with our special nozzle design. ACT will also explore new industrial applications, such as specialized metal manufacturing (via high-pressure gas quench) and high-quality brazing (via controlled cooling rate inside the process furnace) that can be benefited from the proposed inert gas circulation cooling technology. In addition to the high-temperature neutron furnace cooling efforts, ACT will also investigate a novel cryogenic cooling method to aid ORNL with the long cooldown time of dry He cryostats. ACT aims to reduce a 2-hour cooldown time (300K to 80K) to less than 10 minutes with the innovative sample holder with embedded two-phase nitrogen flow. A range of unique solutions will be utilized to improve the heat exchange limited by the Leidenfrost effect.

A critical factor affecting cloud characteristics is the concentration of airborne particles around which cloud droplets form. A significant contributor to these particles is atmospheric nucleation, which injects large numbers of small particles into the atmosphere. Once formed, these particles grow quickly. It is estimated that these nucleation processes and the subsequent particle growth are significant contributors to the number of cloud condensation nuclei, and subsequent cloud formation. Characterizing particle nucleation events, and the dynamics of the evolution of the particle size distribution, is important to improving our understanding of global climate. Yet current observations are limited by size, cost, and the relatively slow pace of the measurement. This is due, in part, to the low charging efficiency in the sub-10nm regime, which leads to long measurement times to obtain sufficient counting statistics. Needed is a compact, rapid-response instrument that can accurately track the evolution in size and concentration of newly formed particles. This project will develop a new measurement system to provide the tools needed to better characterize the physical dynamics associated with these new particle formation events. This system consists of two coupled instruments, one which is quick to sense an atmospheric nucleation event, and one that has the precision to characterize it. The rapidly responding instrument is a Nano-Particle Counter which continuously reports particle concentrations in two nanoparticle size ranges, approximately 2nm-10nm, and 10nm and larger. The precise instrument is an “adaptable” differential mobility analyzer that measures aerosol size distributions based on electrical mobility. This adaptable differential mobility analyzer has several modes of operation, with the capability, in one instrument, to measure freshly nucleated, nanometer sized particles as well as the larger pre-existing aerosol with which these newly formed particles interact. Its “adaptability” is the capacity to readily switch among these size ranges. These two components are coupled through common control, whereby an abundance of 2-10 nm particles that is characteristic of an atmospheric nucleation event triggers the mobility sizing system to direct its measurements to this important nucleation mode. Having demonstrated the efficacy of each of these two approaches, the effort of this project focuses on extending these capabilities, with refinement based on modeling and experimental verification. The instruments will be coupled with common control to provide a single, adaptive measurement system. Adaptive protocols, as well as the instrument components, will be further refined under field testing in conjunction with another air quality measurement program. In addition to the automated adaptive system for studying atmospheric nucleation events, this SBIR project will produce two new instruments, a flexible differential mobility analyzer and a dual size range nanoparticle counter, both of which will see broad application within, and outside of, atmospheric aerosol research.', 'Nathan Kreisberg', None, '(510) 649-9360', 'nathan@aerosol.us', 'Stavros Amanatidis', None, '(510) 649-9360', 'stavros@aerosol.us', None, None, None)\n",

Aerosol size distributions are specifically named by DOE as a parameter that cannot be affordably monitored with currently available methods. The size and concentration of sub-micrometer and ultrafine aerosols are especially critical to evaluating the dynamics of aerosol processes, to identifying sources and origins of new particles and their role in cloud formation, as well evaluating human exposures important to health. Needed are means to map these concentrations with good time and spatial resolution.Vehicle-based platforms, such as instrumented Google street-view cars or mobile monitors, provide air quality data over a large urban environment. However, such ground-based mobile platforms require rapid time response, of the order of one second, as the sampled aerosol is constantly changing. For the critical ultrafine aerosol size range, which cannot be directly measured optically but instead is probed by electrical mobility, the current commercial methods do not have the necessary time resolution. Our approach separates airborne particles spatially in accordance with their electrical mobility, and then counts these particles as a function of their position (and hence size) through condensational growth and optical imaging. The complete size spectrum 10-500 nm size is captured with 10Hz resolution, making feasible accurate measurements on moving platforms.AMI technology uses an innovative approach to facilitate high time resolution measurements within a compact instrument size, representing a significant advance over existing commercially available technologies. Our Phase I project will experimentally evaluate three key components of this approach. First, we experimentally verify the capability of accurately capturing particle positions across the full width of the mobility separator. Second, we will determine the capacity for simultaneous measurement of positive and negative particle mobilities, as this approach has recently been shown to eliminate the need for bipolar ion source. Third, we will evaluate a new concept for the wide-size size range electrode, which has the potential to greatly reduce the required size and cost of the separator. These key steps will allow us in Phase II to design for cost-effective fabrication methods. Through establishing the efficacy of this innovative approach, we aim to provide a compact and affordable instrument for rapid, 1Hz, aerosol size distribution measurement over the critical size range of fine and ultrafine aerosols.Commercial applications span a wide range of industrial and laboratory research uses for which rapid measurements of aerosol size distributions are needed, such as near sources or on mobile platforms.
