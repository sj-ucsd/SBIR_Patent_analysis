Processes of interest for bioenergy include measuring enzyme function within cells, tracking metabolic pathways in vivo, monitoring the transport of materials into and out of cells or across cellular membranes and, measuring signaling process between cells and within plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. High-utility organic products (biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, etc.) are most effectively produced by way of industrial fermentation enabled by microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi. End-product synthesis begins with genetically engineered microbial strains with redirected metabolic paths which either increase the yield of natural metabolites or produce new molecules. Because bioprocess scale-up costs are extremely high, reliable scale-up remains an enormous technical and economic barrier for commercialization of bioprocesses. To provide insight into the metabolic process with the goal of increasing yield, single-cell NMR sensors based on nanodiamond (ND) particles with unique quantum properties are being developed. 13C nuclear spins in nanodiamond will be employed as NMR sensors of the surrounding analyte nuclei.

To improve the current state-of-the-art, a new semiconductor device simulation software that adopts the advanced phonon frequency-dependent Monte Carlo simulation technique to replace the conventional Fourier’s law for the thermal transport modeling is proposed. Monte Carlo simulations track the phonon movement and scattering so that the thermal properties of the nanomaterial can be extracted stochastically. The simulation accuracy will be improved because the proposed Monte-Carlo-based software can incorporate detailed phonon transport physics. The Monte Carlo simulation will be coupled with Charon and Trilinos software packages, which are funded by the Department of Energy and its Office of Advanced Scientific Computing and Research, form a complete semiconductor device simulation software. In Phase I, the coupling between the frequency-dependent phonon Monte Carlo code, Charon, and Trilinos will be performed. Simple one- and two-dimensional test cases will be performed to calibrate the software. In addition, a basic user interface and a material database will be created to improve the user-friendliness of Trilinos and Charon.

Currently, the vacuum furnace relies on radiation to dissipate heat and takes at least 2 hours to cool the furnace low enough to safely open for a sample change. This results in significant limitations of using expensive neutron beam time. To tackle this challenge, ACT proposes an innovative active cooling system to significantly reduce neutron scattering furnaces’ downtime. The system includes a closed helium (He) circulation loop, industrial-grade process control, furnace flow distribution nozzles, and a built-in refrigeration unit to achieve fast and controllable cooling. Due to the much higher thermal conductivity of the He gas compared to other inert gases (e.g., nitrogen, argon), heat can be removed from the system more effectively. By introducing the He flow inside the radiation shields via a flow distributor nozzle, the cooling rate can also be controlled by adjusting the flow rate and overall system pressure. The thermal characteristics and low neutron scattering and adsorption coefficients of He provide the potential for in- situ cooling for advanced material experiments. This will allow experimenters to perform controlled transient thermal tests that could not have been done before. The proposed active cooling system has very low He usage (closed-loop circulation) and requires a minimal human operation. During Phases I and II, a fully operational and mobile prototype cooling system was constructed and tested in the field with an operational HOT-006 neutron furnace at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The He cooling system managed to cool the heating element from 500&#176;C to 100&#176;C in just 8 minutes, a 17 times improvement compared to 2.24 hours for the original radiation-only cooling approach. The thermal stresses on the coil were evaluated, and a proof-of-concept constant cooling rate approach was demonstrated. The successful test at ORNL brings the technology to TRL (Technology Readiness Level) to 7. In Phase IIA, ACT will continue working with ORNL to refine the cooling system, extend its capabilities, and further push for the commercialization of the technology. It will be achieved by extended long-term usage tests at ORNL during mock and live neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, the capabilities of the cooling system will be extended to include rapid sample quenching and a closed-loop controlled cooling rate. The cooling system will also be validated for operation with a cheaper, lower-performance circulation gas medium (nitrogen, argon) with our special nozzle design. ACT will also explore new industrial applications, such as specialized metal manufacturing (via high-pressure gas quench) and high-quality brazing (via controlled cooling rate inside the process furnace) that can be benefited from the proposed inert gas circulation cooling technology. In addition to the high-temperature neutron furnace cooling efforts, ACT will also investigate a novel cryogenic cooling method to aid ORNL with the long cooldown time of dry He cryostats. ACT aims to reduce a 2-hour cooldown time (300K to 80K) to less than 10 minutes with the innovative sample holder with embedded two-phase nitrogen flow. A range of unique solutions will be utilized to improve the heat exchange limited by the Leidenfrost effect. The impact of reduced cooldown time on cryogenic experiments turnaround should be similar to the effect of a cooling system on neutron furnaces., William Anderson, , (717) 205-0602, bill.anderson@1-act.com, Patryk Radyjowski, , (717) 205-0603, patryk.radyjowski@1-act.com, , , \\n7, AEROSOL DYNAMICS INC, Adaptive Measurement of Nuclei Particle Size and Concentration, Department of Energy, , Phase II, SBIR, 271115, DE-SC0022440, 2023-04-03, 04/02/2025, , 2023.0, 12/06/2022, 12/06/2022, 02/10/2023, C53-26a, 2023, 1,624,343, '845314962', N, N, N, 6.0, http://www.aerosol.us, 935 Grayson Street, , Berkeley, CA, 94710-2640, C53-26a-271115The extent, persistence and microphysical properties of clouds influence Earth’s climate and hydrologic cycles.

It is estimated that these nucleation processes and the subsequent particle growth are significant contributors to the number of cloud condensation nuclei, and subsequent cloud formation. Characterizing particle nucleation events, and the dynamics of the evolution of the particle size distribution, is important to improving our understanding of global climate. Yet current observations are limited by size, cost, and the relatively slow pace of the measurement. This is due, in part, to the low charging efficiency in the sub-10nm regime, which leads to long measurement times to obtain sufficient counting statistics. Needed is a compact, rapid-response instrument that can accurately track the evolution in size and concentration of newly formed particles. This project will develop a new measurement system to provide the tools needed to better characterize the physical dynamics associated with these new particle formation events. This system consists of two coupled instruments, one which is quick to sense an atmospheric nucleation event, and one that has the precision to characterize it. The rapidly responding instrument is a Nano-Particle Counter which continuously reports particle concentrations in two nanoparticle size ranges, approximately 2nm-10nm, and 10nm and larger. The precise instrument is an “adaptable” differential mobility analyzer that measures aerosol size distributions based on electrical mobility. This adaptable differential mobility analyzer has several modes of operation, with the capability, in one instrument, to measure freshly nucleated, nanometer sized particles as well as the larger pre-existing aerosol with which these newly formed particles interact. Its “adaptability” is the capacity to readily switch among these size ranges. These two components are coupled through common control, whereby an abundance of 2-10 nm particles that is characteristic of an atmospheric nucleation event triggers the mobility sizing system to direct its measurements to this important nucleation mode. Having demonstrated the efficacy of each of these two approaches, the effort of this project focuses on extending these capabilities, with refinement based on modeling and experimental verification. The instruments will be coupled with common control to provide a single, adaptive measurement system. Adaptive protocols, as well as the instrument components, will be further refined under field testing in conjunction with another air quality measurement program. In addition to the automated adaptive system for studying atmospheric nucleation events, this SBIR project will produce two new instruments, a flexible differential mobility analyzer and a dual size range nanoparticle counter, both of which will see broad application within, and outside of, atmospheric aerosol research., Nathan Kreisberg, , (510) 649-9360, nathan@aerosol.us, Stavros Amanatidis, , (510) 649-9360, stavros@aerosol.us, , , \\n8, AEROSOL DYNAMICS INC, Instantaneous Aerosol Mobility Sizing, Department of Energy, , Phase I, SBIR, 270822, DE-SC0023627, 2023-02-21, 02/20/2024, , 2023.0, 10/17/2022, 10/21/2022, 12/19/2022, C55-16a, 2023, 220,709, '845314962', N, N, N, 6.0, http://www.aerosol.us, 935 Grayson Street, , Berkeley, CA, 94710-2640, With its Urban Integrated Field Laboratories research effort, DOE seeks affordable methods to characterize the urban atmosphere with high time and high spatial resolution.

Third, we will evaluate a new concept for the wide-size size range electrode, which has the potential to greatly reduce the required size and cost of the separator. These key steps will allow us in Phase II to design for cost-effective fabrication methods. Through establishing the efficacy of this innovative approach, we aim to provide a compact and affordable instrument for rapid, 1Hz, aerosol size distribution measurement over the critical size range of fine and ultrafine aerosols.Commercial applications span a wide range of industrial and laboratory research uses for which rapid measurements of aerosol size distributions are needed, such as near sources or on mobile platforms.

Capable of HD resolution, motion deblurring, object/event detection/identification, object tracking, and data compression, the proposed system is meant to resolve current camera lifespan inadequacies while also boosting energy level resistance. This problem is being addressed by utilizing Alphacore’s “Camera-on-Chip&quot; technology where the camera functionality is moved from the FPGA camera control board to the image sensor chip itself. The chip-based camera includes functionality to transfer the image data via a rad-hard cable up to 150ft to an area in the facility that does not include high radiation environment. Now, a radiation-hard camera control board is not needed. During Phase I, Alphacore will characterize and evaluate the first version of the image sensors and perform radiation testing. Based on the results, we will design the final full resolution version of the proposed radiation hardened image sensor. The need for camera on chip technologies for compact digital imaging systems has already diversified into numerous sectors within the energy and commercial industry. While the immediate energy needs of this program are sought for beam and target system diagnostic applications, defense sector applications include Missile attitude detection systems, next-gen ISR missions, security and situational awareness, and numerous space agency mission needs such as identify space-objects in real-time and space-object detection and space-situational awareness (CspOC).\", start_char_idx=19031, end_char_idx=23883, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

First, depth imaging is limited by light scattering and diffraction in biological tissue. Second, classical high flux multiphoton optical imaging causes photo-damage to cellular viability and perturbations to molecular biological processes. This renders the sample unusable for repeated in situ imaging and prohibits measurements of dynamic biological processes within the same biological system over different time intervals. Technologies utilizing single photon detection, with the promise of very low photon fluxes, single photon sensing, time gated photon sensing and ghost imaging using entangled photon pairs capabilities, promise to directly address the above challenges and limitations. While there is considerable activity towards the development of quantum photon sources (e.g., solid state lasers and systems for generation of entangled photons), there is significantly less research and development devoted to quantum photon detectors, i.e., single photon avalanche photodetectors (SPADs). Further, efforts on SPADs have been solely limited to those operating in the visible and telecommunications bands, and not in the biologically important 2080-2340 nm band which is a local minimum in the optical absorption of H2O. SPADS operating at 2080-2340 nm are required for development of the next generation of quantum bioimaging system technology. In this DoE SBIR program, Amethyst Research will develop a technology that will be able to deliver a new class of photo detectors directly addressing the current ‘technology gap’ of SPADs operating in the 2080-2340 nm window.

Through thermal processing this biomass can be converted to a high carbon biochar that could be used as a soil amendment for acidic soils to increase crop production. However, current biochar costs are too high. By coproducing a biofuel with the biochar, biochar costs can be reduced. A patented drop-in biofuels process will be leveraged to also create a low-cost biochar. In addition, carbon dioxide will be adsorbed on the biochar to improve soil amendment characteristics. The goal of the proposed project is to build a larger-scale enhanced biochar production system and operate the system to generate enhanced biochar for improving Controlled Environmental Agriculture (CEA) operations and improve the growth of corn and wheat in field applications in acidic soils. During the Phase I project, the enhanced biochar test system was designed and fabricated, and biochar was produced from corn stover and wheat straw. The biochar was characterized by standard tests and was shown to have good carbon dioxide capture potential and good potential for long-term carbon sequestration. Lettuce plant growth tests under Controlled Environmental Agriculture conditions in pots showed that the enhanced biochar could increase plant production in acidic media by up to 386%. A techno-economic analysis showed that these benefits could be achieved at a cost below $40/ton biochar. In the Phase II project, the enhanced biochar production system will be scaled up by a factor of ten to produce larger quantities of biochar. The corn stover and wheat straw biochar will then be applied to controlled environment agriculture pot studies in the first year of the effort to show the growth improvements with enhanced biochar. In the second year of the project, the enhanced biochar will be applied in field studies to show the growth improvement with corn and wheat in acidic soils.

At the same time, an even larger amount of neutron optics will be required to build the new European Spallation Source in Sweden. These concurrent projects are stretching existing neutron manufacturers, all of which are presently located in Europe, beyond their capacities, thus presenting a unique opportunity for new American manufacturers. American Physics and Technology LLC (APT) is striving to become a trusted domestic supplier for these critically needed optics, one that manufactures the highest quality supermirror optics and competes on price as well. In our previous SBIR project, APT located in Richmond UT, with its suppliers: Rigaku Innovative Technologies (RIT) in Auburn Hills MI a worldwide leader in thin film deposition; Inrad Optics in Northvale NJ with 40+ years of expertise in manufacturing substrates for x-ray optics; and Exogenesis in Billerica MA, an innovator in atomic-scale surface modification technology; manufactured the first American made neutron supermirrors in &gt;20 years. This new proposed SBIR project will increase our capability to mass-produce low-cost conventional neutron guides, mirrors, and filters on flat substrates. In phase-I, we will: a) develop M=4 thin-film coatings, on small coupon samples, to achieve 80% neutron reflectivity at max q, to be measured at the SNS at ORNL; b) research the manufacture of substrates as large as 1000x150 mm made of glass, silicon, and metal, and with special attention to optimizing the surface quality and lowering cost; c) consider the technology and cost required for manufacturing the adjustable mounts and housings that are also required for the mirror assemblies. In phase-II we will demonstrate our ability to manufacture the required meter-sized optics. To date, we have made neutron supermirrors on glass, Si-crystal, and metal substrates, and our first attempts have already demonstrated M=4.5 performance with 75% neutron reflectivity at maximum q on a flat Si-crystal substrate.

Such lasers are not available commercially. With new sources of high-brightness electron beams affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals, the US would be able to maintain its technological leadership. In Phase I, we constructed a proof-of-principle Demonstrator system and experimentally validated our concept. We demonstrated key parameters targeted by the DOE including wavelength tunability from 484 to 643 nm, pulse energy up to 425 &#181;J, and output bandwidth as low as 1 nm. We characterized the performance of the demonstrator system, anchored our predictive models, confirmed energetics, validated the pulse synchronization, and used these results to design the Phase II Prototype driver. Our accomplishments generated an interest by the researchers at a DOE laboratory. In Phase II, we will develop and characterize a prototype photocathode drive laser meeting the DOE functional requirements. Results of Phase I will be extended using our validated approach. Effective thermal management will be implemented for the PA, harmonic conversion crystals, and the OPA crystals to facilitate continuous operation at high-average power. Wavelength selection under computer control with a feedback loop will be created. Means for pulse selection and generation of the objective waveform will be developed.
