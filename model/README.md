This folder contains a binary classification model that classifies entities/terms into technical or non-technical terms. 
The pre-trained model posted here can be directly loaded. The notebook contains code to train the model. RandomForrest 
classification is used. We have also tried scibert from Huggingface but this model seem to work well and faster to train. Details of files:
1. tech_term_classifier.ipynb - RandomForrest classifier for technical terms. Requires tech_terms.txt which is generated by first two notebooks in preprocessing folder
2. trained_tech_classifier_model.joblib.zip - Trained model. Can be loaded directly in any another notebook using joblib for inference

Other files:
1. spacy_helper_methods.ipynb - Spacy pipeline helper functions
